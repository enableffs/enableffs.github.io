        <h3>Inclusion</h3>
        <p>Inclusion is the practice of educating where the learners with impairment are in the same school and class alongside their
            non-disabled peers. The learners with impairment participate full as equally valued and unique individuals.<br>
            The Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education (1994) is arguably the most significant
            <enable-grey-box e-type="quote">Regular schools with (an) inclusive orientation are the most effective means of combating
            discriminatory attitudes, creating welcoming communities, building an inclusive society and achieving education for all.</enable-grey-box>

    </div><p>Unesco´s Guidelines for Inclusion (2005) states:</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote">Education must be viewed as a facilitator in everyone’s human development and
        functionality, regardless of barriers of any kind, physical or otherwise. Therefore, disability
        of any kind cannot be a disqualifier.</enable-grey-box>
        <p>Seven principles on which inclusive education is based:</p>
        <ul><li>Diversity enriches and strengthens all communities.</li>
            <li>All learners' different learning styles and achievements are equally valued, respected and celebrated by society.</li>
            <li>All learners are enabled to fulfil their potential by taking into account individual requirements and needs.</li>
            <li>Support is guaranteed and fully resourced across the whole learning experience.</li>
            <li>All learners need friendship and support from people of their own age.</li>
            <li>All children and young people are educated together as equals in their local communities.</li>
            <li>Inclusive education is incompatible with segregated provision both within and outside mainstream education.</li>
            </ul>

<h4>Is inclusion always promising?</h4>
        <p>Are there no problems with the inclusive setting? No obstacles at all?<br> Listen to Francis Kanubi, Headmaster at Salama School for the Blind, about obstacles for inclusive education in Uganda.</p>

        <h3>Segregation</h3>
        <p>Segregation is when the learners are in a special school where all the other learners are impaired in a segregated education setting. Such a school tend the learners  to lead a separate life from the life outside school.<br> But life is not black or white.<br> Listen to Francis Kanubi about advantages of a special school.</p>

        <h3>Integration</h3>
        <p>Can there be something between inclusion and segregation? Integration is when the learner is being placed in
            mainstream education settings with some adaptations and resources. The structures are pre-existing and the attitudes
            are not changed.<br>Will the learners with impairment participate full and be valued equally and seen as unique individuals in such a setting?</p>
