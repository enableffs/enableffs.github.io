        <h3>What is deafblindness</h3>
        <p>The National Association of the Deafblind in Uganda defines the term deafblindness as follows:</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote">
            Deafblindness is a unique category whereby a person has a combination of severe degrees of hearing and sight loss. </enable-grey-box>
        <p>The nordic definition of deafblindness expand this definition taking limitations and restrictions into account:</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote">Deafblindness is a distinct disability.
            Deafblindness is a combined vision and hearing disability. It limits activities of a person and restricts
            full participation in society to such a degree that society is required to facilitate specific services, environmental
            alterations and/or technology.</enable-grey-box>


        <p>For clarifing the definition some comments are added.</p>
        <enable-read-more label=" Read more about these comments">
            <ol><li>Vision and hearing are central in getting information. Therefore a decrease in the function of these two senses that carry information from distance increases the need to use senses that are confined to information within reach (tactile, kinaesthetic, haptic, smell and taste), as well as leaning on memory and deduction.</li>
                <li>The need for specific alterations regarding environment and services depends on
                    <ul>
                        <li>the time of on-set in relation to communicative development and language acquisition; </li>
                        <li>the degree of the hearing and vision disability, whether it is combined with other disabilities </li>
                    </ul>and whether it is stable or progressive. </li>
                <li>A person with deafblindness may be more disabled in one activity and less disabled in another activity. Therefore each activity and participation in it needs to be assessed separately. Variation in functioning within each activity and participation in it may also be caused by environmental conditions and by internal personal factors. </li>
                <li>Deafblindness causes varying needs for co-creating alterations in all activities and especially in
                    <ul><li>all kinds of information;</li>
                        <li>social interaction and communication;</li>
                        <li>spatial orientation and moving around freely; </li>
                        <li>activities of daily life and effort demanding </li>
                        <li>near-activities including reading and writing. </li></ul>

                    Co-creating means that the person with deafblindness and the environment are equally involved. The responsibility for this to occur lies on society. </li>
                <li>An interdisciplinary approach including specific know-how related to deafblindness is needed in service delivery and environmental alterations.</li>
            </ol>

       <h3>Understanding the deafblind</h3>
        <p> Very few children are totally deafblind. Usually the child will have residual hearing or very poor vision. Sometimes the child has additional impairments requiring special training.
            Ideally, the earlier impairment is detected and interventions made, the better chance for the child to overcome the impairment.
<br>
            Independence and self-reliance are possible for the deafblind. Milestones are slower, may be very slow for some but they can gain them.

        <h3>Acquirement of deafblindness</h3>
        <p>The definitions say nothing about how deafblindness is acquired. It is common to distinguish between <strong>congenital</strong> and <strong>acquired</strong> visual and hearing impairments. Many have had normal vision and / or good hearing earlier in life, but illness, injury or age has weakened senses so much that one uses the term deafblindness.</p>
