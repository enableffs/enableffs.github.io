        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">A common belief is that people with deafblindness live in a completely silent and dark world and that they are often born with deafblindness.</enable-quotebox>
        <p>The truth is most people with dual sensory impairments have a residual vision or hearing residue or both that they can utilize if provision is made for it.</p>
        <ul><li>People who have impaired vision will become dependent on hearing to receive and interpret sounds that can support visual impressions. </li>
        <li>Likewise people who are hard of hearing will depend on the information and support they receive through sight. </li>
        <li>When both the vision and hearing senses are impaired it means that the person cannot compensate by adopting another the other sense.</li></ul>
        <br>
        <p>When the difficulties are so severe that hearing cannot compensate for vision loss and hearing loss cannot be compensated for with vision, the term <strong>deafblindness</strong> is used.</p>
        <h4>Estimated population of people with dual sensory impairment in East Africa</h4>
        <p>There is estimated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>14.000 deafblind people in Uganda of a population of 35 million people.</li>
        <li>17.000 deafblind people in Kenya of a population of 42 million people.</li>
        <li>18.600 deafblind people in Tanzania of a population of 46 million people.</li>
