        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>The ability to communicate is essential to convey our opinions, needs and feelings. Through communication we create social
            relations and make us participate in the life that surround us.<br>

            Communication difficulties appear primarily when the hearing is impaired. If the sight is reduced too, the ability to
            further communication decreases.</p>

        <h3>Main methods of communication</h3>

        <p>Deaf-blind people have many different ways of communication. The methods they use vary, depending on the causes of their combined vision and hearing loss, their backgrounds, and their education.</p>

        <p>The main methods of communication with a deafblind person or between two deafblind people are:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Tactile Sign Language</strong><br>The deaf-blind person puts his or her hands over the signer’s hands to feel the shape, movement and location of the signs.</li>
            <li><strong>Tactile Fingerspelling</strong><br>The deaf-blind person may prefer to put his or her hand over the fingerspelling hand, or on the signer’s palm, or cup his or her hand around the signer’s hand. Usually people who have been deaflind prefer tactile fingerspelling because sometimes sign language can be difficult to learn.</li>

            <li><strong>Haptic communication</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tadoma</strong><br>This is a way for deaf-blind people with little or no usable vision to speechread another person by touch. They put their thumb on the other person’s chin, and their fingers on the other person’s cheek to feel the vibrations of the person’s voice and the movement of their lips.

            <p>Communication is our key here. So once we are able to attune ourselves to the level of the student. When the student
                is brought, the parents brings the student, we tend to ask the parents: How do you communicate with the student at
                home? <br>So we get really the basic, the really simple ways. How the student gets their needs done (?). How the
                student get their want met? <br>Then from there now we pick it and start helping modern (?)the communication of the
                student. So like we, most of the time you find the student their communication yet around their body. So it up to
                (?)us to help them with more activities. The activities help them to now start moving and also trying to interact.
                So like we tend to look a : What is the student interested in? So once we have known the students interest, we have
                know the students strength and how they communicate. So it our responsibility now to start using symbols. We start
                using the whatever more we have seen working with the student. For example you saw Lousie is able to sign, she is a
                very good signer, so she passed the level of using symbols or using objects of reference. So like for Lousie we will
                sign for her. If it is Cedric, we will use the speech, at the same time sign, because he has voice. Sometimes he can
                use a speech. So once we are able to understand his way of communication, we will instruct the student specifically
                geared to what he or her communicate. If is is for the small boy Victor, like we also get him and we use tactile
                signs. So we hold his hands and tell him what is next. So if something is trouble, like we tend to use total
                communication and also add other strategies to make it work for the student.</p>

            <p>The communication, there is a turntaking and during the turntaking you can add special: It is my turn, it is your turn,
                look at me. <br>Then they learn to keep the eyecontact. The bodylanguage you can read from the challenge expression.
                Those one are not interested, then can everybody tell (?) this one is crying. Then they are not. <br>There are those who
                want to go for the toilet. They can tell. Much as (?) they do not have a formal language that you can tell the child once to goM, because they know we dont do it in the water. We have to do it the toilet. So it is a good way for expression and receiving receptions on the children.

        <p>To maintain the contact with others, sounds residues needs to be recovered as far
            as possible. Even if both hearing and vision are lost, the communication with others can be maintained. Be aware of each
            individual is different and requires individual adaptations and communication methods.</p>
