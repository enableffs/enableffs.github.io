    <p>A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing.</p>
    <p>Cochlear implants may help provide hearing in patients who are deaf because of damage to sensory hair cells in their cochleas. In those patients, the implants often can enable sufficient hearing for better understanding of speech. </p>
    <p>The quality of sound is different from natural hearing, with less sound information being received and processed by the brain. However, many patients are able to hear and understand speech and environmental sounds. </p>
    <enable-grey-box e-type="warning"><p>Cochlear implants do not eliminate deafness. An implant is not a cure and an implanted individual is still deaf. Cochlear implants may destroy what remaining hearing an individual may have. If the deaf or hard of hearing child or adult later prefers to use an external hearing aid, that choice may be removed.</p></enable-grey-box>

    <br><p>Four year old Elaine was the first child from Uganda to receive a cochlear implant in 2010. The procedure was done abroad because Uganda had neither the doctors nor the proper equipment to perform the surgery on a child at that time. Two yeas earlier a team of American and Ugandan doctors performed the first surgery of this kind on a 23-year-old man.
