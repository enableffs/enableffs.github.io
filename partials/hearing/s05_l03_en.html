        <h5>Criteria for being a good interpreter</h5>

        <p>"What your limitations are and what your strengths are. When you are sure of the voice you have, then the
            knowledge of the signs will be another advantage. So we normally want the interpreters to know themselves:
            what are they as a strength.</p>

        <p>Then you should be able to be fruitful to yourself, that I am doing what this person cannot do. Because if
            you misinterpret a client, sometimes it is not a good practice at all. So you should be fruitful and be able
            to tell the client that - I did not understood you, can you repeat what you are saying-.</p>

        <p>A good interpreter be able to listen attentively, should be able to voice out, should be able to cooperate
            with the co-interpreters and also cooperate with the clients."</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Important issues when interpreting to sign language</h5>

        <p>"In this class what is important is that the interpreter has the confidence to voice out loudly, loud enough
            for
            the audience to hear. And that the interpreter is able to put himself or herself into the shoes of the
            signer, because
            they act like the voices as those who do not have the voice.</p>

        <p>But they also be mindful of the culture, because sign
            language and spoken language are very different. So they should be able to put in, spice the signs with the
            culture of
            the spoken language.</p>

        <p>They using paralinguistic features, they should be mindful of the intonation, they should be
            mindful over the quality of the voice. The quality will also include the intonation, the pauses and of cause
            they
            have to be knowledgeable of what signsâ€¦ what particular words is suitable for particular signs."</p>
        <h5>Confusion produced when speech and sign language are combined</h5>

        <p>"When we are teaching interpreters we bring(?) different deaf persons, those who are deafen at later age and
            those who are born deaf. You find that most interpreters find it easy to interpret for the deaf persons who
            have speech because they combine their signs with the speech. But they find it hard when somebody has
            completely no speech. But it is sometimes very confusing if somebody is speeching and signing, because then
            your voice, his or her voice they run together. So it really depends. But in this program we encourage even
            those who have no sign language background to join the course and we see that both of them are competing
            very well. So we have the chance to take the students to the deaf community where they experience both
            groups of deaf persons."</p></enable-read-more>
