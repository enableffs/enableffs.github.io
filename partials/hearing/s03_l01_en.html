    <p>The biggest challenge for people with hearing loss is <strong>communication</strong>. Although parts of the sound falls out, it is still possible to perceive somebody is talking. But when some sounds are missing or weak, it may be difficult to understand the exact meaning of what is being said.</p><p> Other people may have difficulty understanding this, for example it may have consequences for the child's language development.</p>
<enable-grey-box e-type="quote">It is always important to create good listening and communication situations regardless of the degree and nature of the hearing loss.</enable-grey-box>

    <p>An<strong> audiogram</strong> is a form where the result of a hearing test is entered. The results of the measured hearing  are characterized in a curve in the audiogram. The curve gives a visual representation of the hearing loss. An audiogram can give a picture of an individuals hearing, but it says nothing about how an individual utilizes auditory impressions. Two people with similar audiograms can have two very different experiences of hearing.</p>
    <p><strong>"The speech banana"</strong> in the audigram shows the area where the speaking voice is at normal hearing. Within this area are all the sounds of the letters themselves.</p>
    <h4>High frequency loss</h4>
    <p><strong>High frequency loss</strong> (ski-slope loss) is the most common type of hearing loss. The line in the audiogram starts high and then falls off as the frequency increases. The result is that people with high frequency loss will have trouble hearing the sounds that distinguish consonants, and that will make it sound like people are mumbling.The consonants "s", "f", "t", th" become difficult to hear. In noisy surroundings it becomes difficult to understand speech. It is easier to hear male  than female voices. Some ambient sounds,such as birds singing, are gone.</p>

    <h4>Cookiebite loss</h4>
    <p>A hearing loss that looks like a bite has been taken out of the middle of your audiogram is called <strong>a cookie bite loss</strong> and it is relatively rare. It means that you hear better in the low and high frequencies but less well in the middle frequencies. Many consonants and vowels are lost. Losses in this area affects:</p>
    <ul><li>speech intelligibility (mids and tweeters)</li>
<li>the perception of environmental sounds</li>
<li>make it difficult to understand speech in noisy surroundings.</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Flat loss</h4>
    <p>A hearing loss which is decreased in all frequency ranges is called <strong>flat loss</strong>. Even if such a loss is relatively uncommon it can affect (depending on the size of the loss):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the speech intelligibility</li>
    <li>the perception of environmental sounds</li>
    <li>understanding speech in noisy surroundings</li>
    </ul>
