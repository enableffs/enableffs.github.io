    <p>The biggest challenge for people with hearing loss is <strong>communication</strong>. Although parts of the sound falls out,
        it is still possible to perceive somebody is talking. But when some sounds are missing or weak, it may be difficult to
        understand the exact meaning of what is being said.</p><p> Other people may have difficulty understanding this, for
        example it may have consequences for the child's language development.</p>

<h3>Conditions for developing communication skills</h3>
        <p>Deaf and hearing-impaired children often have a poor conceptual framework and difficulty to reflect on their own and others'
    feelings and experiences. The result can be can social difficulties and difficulties in making friends. Because of lack of
    basic concepts many children are struggling academically at school. For getting a good language development sign language
    environment is absolutely essential for these children. It is a precondition for social adjustment and for good mental health
    later in life to create an inner voice for thinking and understanding. It is essential that parents and children get the
    opportunity to communicate well right from the start. That's when the connection between parents and children formed and the
    interplay between them should start.<br>For hard of hearing children early communication with sign language in addition to
    speech is an advantage for the development of spoken language and concepts and have good impact on later reading and writing
    skills.</p>

   <h4>Audiogram</h4>
   <p>The <strong> audiogram</strong> is a graph which gives a detailed description of your hearing ability. It describes which sounds can be heard and which sounds are missing. The results of the measured hearing  are characterized in a curve in the audiogram. The curve gives a visual representation of the hearing loss. An audiogram can give a picture of an individuals hearing, but it says nothing about how an individual utilizes auditory impressions. Two people with similar audiograms can have two very different experiences of hearing.</p>
        <h4>Examples of sounds without and with hearing loss.</h4>
        <p>These examples of hearing tries to simulate how different hearing loss can turn out.</p>

<h4>The "speech banana"</h4>
        <p>The "speech banana" in the audigram shows the area where the speaking voice is at normal hearing. Within this area are all the sounds of the letters themselves.</p>

    <h4>High frequency loss</h4>
    <p><strong>High frequency loss</strong> (ski-slope loss) is the most common type of hearing loss. The line in the audiogram starts high and then falls off as the frequency increases. The result is that people with high frequency loss will have trouble hearing the sounds that distinguish consonants, and that will make it sound like people are mumbling. In this example the consonants "f", "g", "k", "s", "t" and th" become difficult to hear. In noisy surroundings it becomes difficult to understand speech. It is easier to hear male  than female voices. Some ambient sounds, such as birds singing, are gone.</p>

    <h4>Cookiebite loss</h4>
    <p>A hearing loss that looks like a bite has been taken out of the middle of your audiogram is called <strong>a cookie bite loss</strong> and it is relatively rare. It means that you hear better in the low and high frequencies but less well in the middle frequencies. In this example many consonants, "ch", "g", "h", "k", "p", "r", "sh", and  the vowel "a" are lost. Losses in this area affects:</p>
    <ul><li>speech intelligibility (mids and tweeters)</li>
<li>the perception of environmental sounds</li>
<li>make it difficult to understand speech in noisy surroundings.</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Flat loss</h4>
    <p>A hearing loss which is decreased in all frequency ranges is called <strong>flat loss</strong>. Even if such a loss is relatively uncommon it can affect (depending on the size of the loss):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the speech intelligibility</li>
    <li>the perception of environmental sounds</li>
    <li>understanding speech in noisy surroundings</li>
    </ul>
