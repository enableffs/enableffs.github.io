       <p>When the air around us starts moving, for example when we use our voice, a sound wave is created.</p> <p>The external ear intercepts the sound waves which passes through the middle ear and continue to the internal ear. There the waves are processed and tranfered to the brain. When the signals reach the brain they are interpreted and we start to hear a sound.</p>
    
       <p>The ear and the brain have to work together if we are to hear. If they don't cooperate, the result can be different kinds of <strong>hearing loss</strong> or even <strong>deafness</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Hearing loss refers to both complete and partial loss of the ability to hear. ‘Hard of hearing’ refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. They usually communicate through spoken language and can benefit from assistive devices.</li>
    <li>Deafness refers to profound hearing loss, which implies very little or no hearing. ‘Deaf’ people mostly use sign language for communication.</li>
    </ul>
    <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">The majority of people with moderate-to-profound hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries.</enable-quotebox>
    <h4>The anatomy of the ear</h4>
     <p>When sound waves reach the ear, they travel down the ear canal and hit the eardrum (tympanic membrane), making it vibrate. Three tiny bones (malleus, incus, stapes) in the middle ear link the vibrating eardrum to a tiny bone structure in the inner ear called the cochlea.</p>

<p>The cochlea is filled with liquid that carries the vibrations to thousands of tiny hair cells. The movement in the fluid causes the cells to carry a message to the nerve that is connected to the brain, which turns the signals into what you hear.</p>

    <h4>Description of the main parts of the ear:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Pinna (Auricle)<enable-read-more label="Read more">Pinna (Auricle) is the visible part of the ear that resides outside of the head. The auricle functions to collect sound and transform it to directional and other information. The auricle collects sound and acting as a funnel amplifies this and directs it to the auditory canal. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auricle_(anatomy)">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Auditory canal <enable-read-more label="Read more">The ear canal (external auditory meatus, external acoustic meatus, EAM), is a tube running from the outer ear to the middle ear. The adult human ear canal extends from the pinna to the eardrum and is about 2.5 centimetres (1 in) in length and 0.7 centimetres (0.3 in) in diameter. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Ear drum (Tympanic membrane) <enable-read-more label="Read more">In human anatomy, the eardrum, or tympanic membrane, is a thin, cone-shaped membrane that separates the external ear from the middle ear in humans and other tetrapods. Its function is to transmit sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear, and then to the oval window in the fluid-filled cochlea. Hence, it ultimately converts and amplifies vibration in air to vibration in fluid. The malleus bone bridges the gap between the eardrum and the other ossicles. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Malleus<enable-read-more label="Read more">The malleus or hammer is a hammer-shaped small bone or ossicle of the middle ear which connects with the incus and is attached to the inner surface of the eardrum. It transmits the sound vibrations from the eardrum to the incus. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Incus<enable-read-more label="Read more">The incus is a bone in the middle ear. The anvil-shaped small bone is one of three ossicles in the middle ear. The incus receives vibrations from the malleus, to which it is connected laterally, and transmits these to the stapes, medially.(Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incus">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Stapes<enable-read-more label="Read more">The stapes is a bone in the middle ear of humans and other mammals which is involved in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear. The stirrup-shaped small bone is on and transmits these to the oval window, medially. The stapes is the smallest and lightest named bone in the human body. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapes">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Tympanum cavity<enable-read-more label="Read more">The tympanic cavity is a small cavity surrounding the bones of the middle ear. On its lateral surface, it abuts the external auditory meatus from which it is separated by the tympanic membrane (eardrum). (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanic_cavity">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Temporal bone<enable-read-more label="Read more">The temporal bones are situated at the sides and base of the skull, and lateral to the temporal lobes of the cerebrum. The temporal bone supports that part of the face known as the temple and houses the structures of the organ of hearing. The lower seven cranial nerves and the major vessels to and from the brain traverse the temporal bone. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Semicircular ducts<enable-read-more label="Read more">A semicircular canal or a semicircular duct is one of three semicircular, interconnected tubes located inside each ear. The three canals are, the horizontal semicircular canal, superior semicircular canal, and the posterior semicircular canal. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Cochlea<enable-read-more label="Read more">The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a spiral-shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth, in humans making 2.5 turns around its axis, the modiolus. A core component of the cochlea is the <enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_of_Corti">Organ of Corti</enable-link>, the sensory organ of hearing, which is distributed along the partition separating fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Auditory nerve<enable-read-more label="Read more">The auditory nerve (also cochlear or acoustic nerve) is one of two parts of the vestibulocochlear nerve, a cranial nerve present in amniotes. The cochlear nerve carries auditory sensory information from the cochlea of the inner ear directly to the brain. The other portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve is the vestibular nerve, which carries spatial orientation information to the brain from the semicircular canals. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Auditory (Eustachian) tube<enable-read-more label="Read more">The auditory tube, also known as the Eustachian tube or pharyngotympanic tube, is a tube that links the nasopharynx to the middle ear. It is a part of the middle ear. In adult humans the auditory tube is approximately 35 mm (1.4 in) long. (Source:<enable-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube">Wikipedia</enable-link></enable-read-more></li>
    <li>Vestibular nerve<enable-read-more label="Read more">The vestibular nerve is one of the two branches of the Vestibulocochlear nerve (the cochlear nerve being the other). In humans the vestibular nerve transmits sensory information transmitted by vestibular hair cells located in the two otolith organs (the utricle and the saccule) and the three semicircular canals via the vestibular ganglion. Information from the otolith organs reflects gravity and linear accelerations of the head. Information from the semicircular canals reflects rotational movement of the head. Both are necessary for the sensation of body position and gaze stability in relation to a moving environment.
