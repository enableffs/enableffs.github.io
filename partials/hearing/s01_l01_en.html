       <p>When the air around us starts moving, for example when we use our voice, a sound wave is created.</p> <p>The external ear intercepts the sound waves which passes the middle ear and continue through the internal ear. There the waves are processed and tranfered to the brain. When the signals reach the brain they are interpreted and we start to hear a sound.</p>
       <br>
       <p>The ear and the brain have to work together if we are to hear. If they don't cooperate, the result can be different kinds of hearing loss or even deafness.</p>
