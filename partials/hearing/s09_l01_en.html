Project workers provide Ugandan Sign Language training to deaf children, which not only improves communication skills but also allows them to access information that hasn’t been previously available to them.

<li>Uganda National Association of the Deaf (UNAD)</li>
<enable-read-more label="Read more about UNAD">UNAD are working with UNAD to address the lack of access to quality primary education in Uganda’s Jinga district. There are many barriers that prevent deaf children and young people accessing education including stigma, language issues, poor educational systems and a lack of qualified professionals and resources to support learning. This project seeks to address these barriers through providing training to teachers to equip them with the skills required to better meet the needs of a deaf child and providing materials to support learning. Awareness raising initiatives such as community events and media work aim to address prevailing stigma highlighting that deaf children can and should receive an education resulting in increased enrolment rates. The project works with deaf youth groups and parents groups providing capacity building and advocacy skills to empower and lobby key stakeholders to ensure education is prioritised.</enable-read-more>

Through providing training to teachers and increased resources and learning materials, the project aims to increase enrolment and retention rates of deaf children. The project also provides training to parents and families to improve communications and support available to deaf children at home.
