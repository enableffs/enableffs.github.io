        <h4>The main ways of communication</h4>

        <p>Deaf people and people who are hard of hearing communicate differently.<br>While <strong>sign
            language</strong> is the main way of communication for deaf people, <strong>voice amplified through hearing
            aids</strong> and <strong>lips reading</strong> are the most important ways for communication for people who
            are heard of hearing.</p>
