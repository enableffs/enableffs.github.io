    <h3>How to use a hearing aid</h3>
    <p>The hearing aid is a sophisticated audio amplifier which to some extent can compensate for hearing loss. Since hearing 
    loss is individual, hearing aid must be adapted to each user.</p><p>The hearings aid amplifiers not all sounds like a lot, 
    but emphasizes the sounds that the user has difficulty perceiving. But the soundscape emanating from the hearing aid is not 
    as clearly as the soundscape a person with normal hearing experience. Therefore hearing aid users should  get used to the 
    sound image from the instrument and learn how to interpret this.</p> 
   
    <enable-grey-box >Since hearing loss is different and is compensated 
    differently, the sound experienced will be different for each indidual.</enable-grey-box>
    .
    <p>Even if a hearing aid will not provide the normal hearing function,  many "Hard of hearing"-people  will have 
    great affordance of a hearing aid. Since the user of a hearing aid must learn to listen in a new way, it takes time to adjust to hearing aid. A hearing aid will amplify sounds which is not heard in a long time or maybe never heard. In the beginning it is 
    recommended that you become familiar with the daily sounds and where they come from. Initially, the sounds could be heard 
    unfamiliar, but the user will gradually get used to them.</p><p>By talking or reading aloud to himself one becomes accustomed to his 
    own voice. Eventually you can go to quiet places, outside the home - a park or forest and listen to the sounds there. 
    Places with traffic noise should be avoided, for it can be experienced very noisy at first.</p>

<h4>Conversation with others</h4>
<p>Initially use hearing aid when talking to a person you are familiar with. Let the conversation take place in a quiet place. Tell the other person you are wearing a hearing aid and ask the other to talk in normal tone of voice. It is important that the face of the speaker is seen. 
Eventually you can try to participate in conversations under more noisy conditions. Then you will be able to find out in which situationst he hearing aid works best.</p>
