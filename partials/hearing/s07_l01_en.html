            <div style="width: 65%"><p>One of the main impacts of hearing loss is on the individualâ€™s ability to communicate with others. Spoken language development is often delayed in children with deafness.
Hearing loss and ear diseases such as otitis media can have a significantly adverse effect on the academic performance of children.<br>However, when opportunities are provided for people with hearing loss to communicate, they can participate on an equal basis with others. The communication may be through spoken/-written language or through sign language.</p></div>
