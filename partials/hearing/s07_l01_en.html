     <p>Your child may have trouble finding where sounds are coming from. This is known as localization. Localization is important when listening in groups of people. It helps direct us to who is talking at any moment. If a child takes longer to identify who is talking, he or she may miss some of the message. Localization is also important for safety. If your child is near the street, riding a bike, or even learning to drive, he or she may have trouble localizing a horn.
Your child may have difficulty understanding speech in noisy situations. Two normal hearing ears help us to filter out noise to better hear speech.
Your child may have an especially difficult time hearing you from another room or from outside. When two normal hearing ears hear together, sound seems louder. When a child has UHL, he or she can often hear speech from a distance but may not always understand what is being said.
Remember, your child is in the process of developing language. He or she cannot make a guess or "fill in the gaps" about what he or she didn't understand.</p>
     <p>From where did the sound came?</p>
     <p>For people with unilateral hearing loss it is not easy to locate the sound. Sound localization is one of the challenges related to unilateral hearing loss. Localization is important when listening in groups of people. It helps direct us to who is talking at any moment. If a child takes longer to identify who is talking, he or she may miss some of the message. Localization is also important for safety, if the child is near the street, he or she may have trouble localizing a horn.</p><p>Other challenges can be:</p>
     <ul><li>Evaluation of the distance to the audio input.</li>
     <li>Speech intelligibility from the side with hearing loss</li>
     <li>Speech perception and communication in noisy environments. Two normal hearing ears help us to filter out noise to better hear speech.</li>
     </ul>
     <enable-grey-box >Having unilateral hearing loss will mean to have a hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing in the other.</enable-grey-box>
     <p>When there is a big difference between hearing the left and right ears , the processing of audio signals from the side with hearing loss can often be reduced . One may find that the audio signals coming into the side with hearing loss , are not used . This is a dynamic that person does not govern themselves.</p>
