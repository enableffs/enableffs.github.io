 <enable-quick-question e-question="Did you know...?" e-answer="Did you know that although education of the deaf is now a right in Uganda, only 10% of the hearing impaired children are enrolled for the primary education."></enable-quick-question>
<p>In Uganda 90 % of deaf children are not offered eduaction.<br>How will their future be?<br>The society becomes more and more independent of citizens who are well educated and hearing impaired citizens are a resource for the community which can be taken into use. The education of hearing impaired children can be done in two ways, either in a special school or the students can be included in an ordinary class together with hearing students. There are advantages and disadvantages to both education systems.</p>

            <p>"We started this with some few parents, a group of parents who come together. (Col de padeka). The parents of Deaf
                Childrens Association. They came together to form a group to see a way of training their children. After seeing
                their children learning here from primary level up to seven, there were
                no way they could go. They decided to alist, get away of catering them in vocational skills, training skills. That is why in
                2004 we open this  vocational section, with carpentry,brogling (bricklaying?) and tailoring.<br><br>
                The best thing we need here is communication which is sign language.
                We intend/append? to bring all the parents with their
 children to train them in sign language so that communication can be easier. Here we teach the teacher and the child and the 
 child and the parent.<br><br>These teachers we have here, not all of them are trained in special needs education. But we 
 endeavor, let me put it right, every Wednesday we convert(?) here for sign language training for everybody when wishes, 
 newcomers and their parents to acquire sign language training. For that, when this children, they are very well graduated 
 from here –from that level of craft. But I have to tell you that when I move out even in town, when I come across them in the
 workshops, they are living some better life as compared when they were living earlier back home. They are living their own life, 
 at least something can give some for daily living.<br><br>
The comparison between the hearing and the deaf, in the beginning it was difficult, but now that he way of communication is 
easier, the comparison is now becoming perfect in the sense that even the hearing themselves would judge their ear? They are
now helping us as interpreters because they can hear and they can sign. So it is making learning here almost becoming perfect. "</p></enable-read-more>

        <h4>Listen to the interview with Edith Aceno Wambore, teacher at Karanda Primary School.</h4>
        <enable-audio sndid="edith"></enable-audio>
        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview">
            <h4>About Rose</h4>

            <p> Rose is one of our girls here. She came  here in class one and we realized that she was hearing impaired when she was brought (born?). We had to get her historical background and then after that she was given the right placement in class one were she interacted with the other learners. Through difficulty madame Rose manage to have an interpreter. Madame Rose interpret a little bit and then she was depended to give her (?). At least a child at her age that could help her with interpretation because we discovered that children learn faster than the elders. and we went together class two until now. She never repeated a class. Every year she reached the next level and now she is in grade eight.</p>

                <h4>How is it to have a hearing impaired child in the class?</h4>

                <p>No it is okey because at least it is a way of enabling her community members to communicate with her. You know children are acters or agents of change and by having a such a child in class here. When they meet other children how also are hearing impaired, at least they can communicate to them because I always discovered that most of these children special need children, they kind of feel withdrawn because they dont have friends around. But the fact that we have them here at school have enabled other community members to accept them. Even the parents feel to hide their children at home and now coming to us and requesting to put the children in school. We even have worse cases and other cases. From at least we are going to meet these children, we are getting to breed them. They are being accepted by the community members, they are being accepted by their parents and the entire community even if they are not trained.</p>

                <h4>What about the other children?</h4>
                <p>They do communicate, but not as  much as telling them. You know everything is developing and challenging. She

        <h3>Special schools for the deaf students</h3>
        <h4>Students learn sign language as their mother tongue</h4>
        <p>At Uganda school for the Deaf the pupils learn sign language as their mother tongue and english or other as their foreign language. It is impossible to use sign language with spoken language simultaneously; that is why sign language is still a challenge to the learners', education and parents'.</p>
        <h4>Evaluation of deaf students</h4>
        <p>The current National Primary Leaving Examination in Uganda demands the Deaf to be fluent in English before they are graded in a
            given subject, which situation ignores the fact that, learning any second language is influenced by ones mother tongue.</p>
        <p>In their examination regulations "The Uganda National Examinations Board" allows deaf candidates to be guided by sign language
            interpreters and readers who are expected to tape record candidates responses.</p><p>Nevertheless, as a result, majority of the
        deaf adolescents end up failing exams and eventually dropping out of school.</p>
