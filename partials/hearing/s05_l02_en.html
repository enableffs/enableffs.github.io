            <div style="width: 45%"><p>Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages have been developed. A
                common misconception is that all sign languages are the same worldwide. Each country generally has its
                own, native sign language, and some have more than one. Inside Kenya there are some dialect differences
                between Kisumu and Mombasa. At the same time, sign languages may share similarities to each other.<br>
                Here are some of the letters in Kenyan Sign Language which is used by over half of the country's
                estimated 600,000 deaf population.</p></div>

        <p>First the children imitate the teachers movement and copy them. Then they learn new concepts and signs
            through fysical acticities. New signs are presented in different representations; as physical objects, as
