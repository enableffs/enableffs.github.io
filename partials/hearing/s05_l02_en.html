        <enable-read-more label="Read his story">


            <p>I was born in Uganda at a time when education for the deaf still was at a low level. My mother wanted
                me
                to have a good education so I was sent to Kenya to live with my uncle and to attend a school were I
                was
                thought sign language. So my first language was sign language. But still it was really difficult for
                me
                to communicate with my family and other hearing persons, because they did not know sign language. I
                continued to work hard, and my mother helped me to learn to read and write English. However the
                communication with hearing people still was really difficult, as it was for many other deaf people
                in
                Uganda.</p>

            <h4>The key that opened our doors</h4>

            <p>In the 1990’s a group of deaf people started an advocacy to improve their lives and Uganda National
                Association for the Deaf grew bigger. At about this time sign language was recognized as a language
                in
                the constitution, which was really important for the deaf community. This also meant that sign
                language
                was accepted in schools. To have an own language made it easier to communicate, and it also made
                deaf
                people feel proud. </p>

            <h4><i>"The hearing community and the deaf community came together though an
                interpreter" </i></h4>


            <p>Even though the communication became easier between deaf people with an own language, it was still
                some challenges communicating with the hearing. And when I met Prossy (Proscovia Suubi Nantongo,
                Lecturer, Kyambogo University) and started to teach her sign language and to interpret it was a real
                breakthrough. Using her as an interpreter made it so much easier to communicate with the hearing. So
                the association continued to carrying out programs and demanding services for the deaf. And when
                using interpreters the work was less difficult.</p>

            <h3>My advices for deaf people</h3>

            <p>I was lucky to have a mother who gave me the support and the opportunity to have so much education.
                In 2012 I was the first deaf African to finish my PhD in linguistics. But I met a lot of challenges
                on my way. </p>

            <p>My advice is to work hard and be patient. You have to work hard and look for channels were you would
                attend something that will make you better. Sometimes it is difficult, but if you have a goal you
                can achieve it. So many things can come your way, and prevent you from achieving your goal, but I
                had my family and council, and I asked for help on my way. And here I am now, achieving my goal.</p>

            <p>Secondly, some deaf people are born with hearing parents. They have some other challenges, and some
                won’t accept their deaf child. I think the number one thing is acceptance! And also parents learning
                sign language is very important. </p>

            <p>My experience is that I can’t communicate very well with my father because he doesn’t now sign
                language. I always have to look for an interpreter to communicate with him. </p>

            <p>I urge parent to learn sign language so they can talk to their children. It’s so much easier to
                communicate with the same language.</p>

        <br>
        <p>First the children imitate the teachers movement and copy them.<br>Then they learn new concepts and signs
            through fysical acticities.<br>New signs are presented in different representations;<br>- as physical objects,<br>- as
            drawings and<br>- as written words.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Various modalities (New page will be added)</h2>
        <p>Total Communication (TC) is an approach to deaf education that aims to make use of a number of modes of communication depending on the particular needs and abilities of the child.<br>Source: Wikipedia.<br><br>
           TC is rather a philosophy than a methodology. Therefore the implementation of the philosophy with one
            child may look entirely different than its implementation with another child.<br><br>The modalities of communication can be:</p>

        <ul><li>Formal signs</li>
            <li>Natural gestures</li>
            <li>Fingerspelling</li>
            <li>Gestures </li>
            <li>Body language</li>
            <li>Written text</li>
            <li>Visual aids</li>
            <li>Listening</li>
            <li>Lipreading</li>
            <li>Speech</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since TC is depending on the particular needs of the child, th challenge is to find the communication method(s) most appropriate for a particular child at a particular stage of development.
        There would be situations when spoken communication might be appropriate, other situations where signing might be appropriate, others that would call for written communication, and
            still others where simultaneous communication might work best.<br>Source: Access for all. Solit, Taylor & Bednarczyk, 1992.</p>
        <h4>The benefits of a total communication approach</h4>
        <p>TC allows a variety of combinations it can open all avenues and modes of communication for the deaf child. If the effectiveness of communication is more important than the form it takes,
            then TC is beneficial because it allows the child to use the form that is best for him in any given situation (Pathways for exceptional children. Kaplan, 1996). By using a total approach of speaking and signing, all
            members of the family, those who are deaf as well as those who are hearing, have continuous access to the communication occurring in their environment (A resource manual of deafness. Baker, 1992). </p>
        <h4>The limitations of a total communication approach</h4>
        <p>TC often becomes a simultaneous practice of combining signs and fingerspelling with spoken components. Since simultaneous communication by spoken language and sign language uses a
            different grammar and syntax, it becomes a form of pidgin sign language. If the teacher or a parent compromise between the two methods will the child see a good representation of
            the spoken word or sign language or will the child see only poor examples
        of broken languages? Will manually coded speech leads to better reading and writing scores in the classroom?</p>

        <h2>Bilingualism (New page will be added)</h2>
        <p>Bilingual education is the only way for deaf children to gain equal opportunities and allowing them to become full citizens in their own right. According to
            <enable-link href="http://www.eud.eu/files/8514/5803/7674/brussels_declaration_FINAL.pdf">The Brussels Declaration on Sign Languages</enable-link> becoming bilingual in the national
            sign language and the written language of one’s country of residence is a fundamental right for deaf children. National sign languages are the mother tongues of deaf people and the
            only language they can acquire fully and effortlessly. To function in society it is essential for deaf children to become proficient in the respective (written) language of the country.
            Becoming bilingual in the national sign language and the written language of one’s country of residence is a basic human right for deaf children in education.</p>
        <p>Hear Dr. Joseph Valente talking about "Hearing the unheard" at TEDx. The talk is about the importance of bilingualism for deaf children.</p>
