        <h3>Sound</h3>

        <p>Sound is described as waves or oscillation. Long waves gives the sound a bass character and short waves gives
            the sound treble characteristiscs.</p>

        <p>The pitch of the waves are measured in Hertz (Hz) which is the number of cycles of waves per second.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A pitch which has many cycles per second will be experienced as a high pitch because it has a high frequency of waves.</li>
            <li>A pitch which has fewer cycles per second we will experienced as a low pitch because it has low frequency of waves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The intensity of sound or the volume is measured in decibel (dB). Normal voice from the distance of 1 metre
            is around 60 dB and high music is around 100-110 dB. If the sound is around 110-130 dB most people will find
            it strong and hurting the ear.</p>

        <p> Usually the sound moves around the air with the speed of 330 metres per second, but under water the sound
            moves much faster, around 1400 m/s.</p>

        <h3>Level of impairment</h3>

        <p>Hearing impairment can vary from no impairment to deafness. The World Health Organisation (WHO) describe grades of
            hearing impairment as follow:</p>
        <table>

                <td>25 dB or better (better ear)</td>
                <td>No or very slight hearing problems. Able to hear whispers.</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>

                <td>41-60 dB (better ear)</td>
                <td>Able to hear and repeat words spoken in raised voice at 1 metre.</td>
                <td>Hearing aids usually recommended.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3 - Severe impairment</td>
                <td>61-80 dB (better ear)</td>
                <td>Able to hear some words when shouted into better ear.</td>
                <td>Hearing aids needed. If no hearing aids available, lip-reading and signing should be taught.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4 - Profound impairment including deafness</td>
                <td>81 dB or greater (better ear)</td>
                <td>Unable to hear and understand even a shouted voice.</td>
                <td>Hearing aids may help understanding words. Additional rehabilitation needed. Lip-reading and manual methods of communication is essential.</td>

        <p>Grades 2, 3 and 4 are classified as <strong>disabling hearing impairment.</strong></p>

        <enable-grey-box><h4>Disabling hearing loss refers to:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>- hearing loss greater than 40 decibels (dB) in the better hearing ear in adults</li>
                <li>- hearing loss greater than 30 dB in the better hearing ear in children</li>
            </ul>
        </enable-grey-box>

        <h3>Causes of hearing loss and deafness</h3>

        <p>The causes of hearing loss and deafness can be divided into <strong>congenital causes</strong> and <strong>acquired</strong>
            causes.</p>
        <h4>Congenital causes</h4>

        <p>Congenital causes may lead to hearing loss being present at or acquired soon after birth. Hearing loss can be
            caused by hereditary and non-hereditary genetic factors or by certain complications during pregnancy and
            childbirth, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>maternal rubella, syphilis or certain other infections during pregnancy;</li>
            <li>low birth weight;</li>
            <li>birth asphyxia (a lack of oxygen at the time of birth);</li>
            <li>inappropriate use of particular drugs during pregnancy, such as aminoglycosides, cytotoxic drugs,
                antimalarial drugs and diuretics;
            </li>
            <li>severe jaundice in the neonatal period, which can damage the hearing nerve in a newborn infant.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Acquired causes</h4>

        <p>Acquired causes may lead to hearing loss at any age, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>infectious diseases such as meningitis, measles and mumps;
            </li>
            <li>chronic ear infections;<br>
                <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Chronic ear infections are a leading cause of hearing loss
                </enable-quotebox>
            </li>

            <li>collection of fluid in the ear (otitis media);<br>
                <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Among children, chronic otitis media is the leading cause of hearing
                    loss
                </enable-quotebox>
            </li>
            <li>use of particular drugs, such as some antibiotic and antimalarial medicines;</li>
            <li>injury to the head or ear;</li>
            <li>excessive noise, including occupational noise such as that from machinery and explosions, and
                recreational noise such as that from personal audio devices, concerts, nightclubs, bars and sporting
                events;
            </li>
            <li>ageing, in particular due to degeneration of sensory cells;</li>
            <li>wax or foreign bodies blocking the ear canal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Treatment and prevention of hearing loss</h3>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="warning">50% of hearing loss is preventable through public health actions
        </enable-grey-box>
        <p>The public health actions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>immunization</li>
            <li>healthy ear and hearing care habits</li>
            <li>effective treatment for both acute and chronic ear conditions</li>
            <li>good nutrition</li>

        <h4>An example</h4>
        <enable-grey-box >About 60% of the children at the Uganda School for the Deaf were born hearing. Many contracted childhood diseases like Mumps, Measles, Whooping Cough, High Fever, Meningitis and Malaria that resulted in their Deafness. For some, their mothers contracted rubella during prenancy. Others lost hearing due to chronic otitis media left untreated for many years, while others get the problem through drug side effects. Other causes are not yet know.</enable-grey-box>
