<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>Sound is described as waves or oscillation. Long waves gives the sound a bass character and short waves gives the sound treble characteristiscs.</p>
<p>The pitch of the waves are measured in Hertz (Hz) which is the number of cycles of waves per second.</p> 
<ul>
    <li>A tone with many cycles per second we will experience as high, the tone has a high frequency.</li><li>A tone with fewer cycles per second we will experience as low, the tone has a low frequency.</li></ul> 
<p>The intensity of sound or the volume is measured in decibel (dB). Normal voice from the distance of 1 metre is around 60 dB and high music is around 100-110 dB. If the sound is around 110-130 dB most people will find it embarrassing.</p><p> Usually the sound moves around the air with the speed of 330 metres per second, but under water the sound moves much faster, around 1400 m/s.</p>
<h3>Grades of hearing impairment</h3>
<p>Hearing can vary from no impairment to deafness. The World Health Organisation (WHO) describe grades of hearing impairment as follow:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>0 - No impairment:</strong> 25 dB or better (better ear). No or very slight hearing problems. Able to hear whispers.</li>
<li><strong>1 - Slight impairment:</strong> 26-40 dB (better ear). Able to hear and repeat words spoken in normal voice at 1 metre. <br><ul><li>Recommendations: Counselling. Hearing aids may be needed.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>2 - Moderate impairment:</strong> 41-60 dB (better ear). Able to hear and repeat words spoken in raised voice at 1 metre. <br><ul><li>Recommendations: Hearing aids usually recommended.</li></ul> </li>
<li><strong>3 - Severe impairment:</strong> 61-80 dB (better ear). Able to hear some words when shouted into better ear.<br><ul><li>Recommendations: Hearing aids needed. If no hearing aids available, lip-reading and signing should be taught.</li></ul> </li>
<li><strong>4 - Profound impairment including deafness:</strong> Unable to hear and understand even a shouted voice.<br><ul><li>Recommendations: Hearing aids may help understanding words. Additional rehabilitation needed. Lip-reading and sometimes signing essential.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Grades 2, 3 and 4 are classified as <strong>disabling hearing impairment.</strong></p>
