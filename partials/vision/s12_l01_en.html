        <p>People with visual impairment have ability to make their career choices. What is important is the support

                (KISE). He works with rehabilitation of persons who have lost their sight
                late in life. They learn how to communicate with digital technology, mobility and activity daily living. Listen to
                him or read the transcribed interview.</p></div>

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><p>It is our recognition that quite a number of people are loosing
            sight out there later in life. And many of them have to drop out of their employment because they are not able to cope
            with the challenges and maybe also be under study by their employers. They seem to believe that once you have lost your
            sight you become to a disability into the company or organisation and any many of them have taken an early retirement.
            We recognize that the new constitution requires that every institution or organisation should employ at least five
            percent. Five percent of the employees should be those with disabilities. We are recognizing then that we need to
            equip the persons with disabilities who are our colleges with skills that will make them become as useful as they
            have been even if they have been to a lower degree than those in the organisation who are employed. So we have started
            advertising ourselves, we have started going around to identify those people who are loosing sight and maybe hanging
            out. They do no know what to do. We bring them back; equip them with necessary skills so they can resume their
            employment at least.<br>We know we cannot achieve 100 %. It is our duty is to enable the affected individuals,
            the employers, at least persons who have some limitations. We are able to perform this way and that is the degree.
            We know, a driver may not go back to driving but they can still be utilized, we need them employed in the institution,
            doing some other kind of work. But we start to move towards the ghetto, and there is a lot to do in the field of
            modern technology, so our concern is to equip all persons with visually impairment particularly with adapted
            technology skills. We know others have trained them before from diverse institutions, do not have the computer
            skills. They remain to employ some readers, but we know if they equipped with those skills, access information,
            at least much of the information they are required to work with through the computer.</p>
