                Institute of Special Education
                (KISE). He works with rehabilitation of persons who have lost their sight
                late in life. They learn how to communicate with digital technology, mobility and activity daily living.

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><p>It is our recognition that quite a number of people
            are loosing
            sight out there later in life. And many of them have to drop out of their employment because they are not
            able to cope
            with the challenges and maybe also be under study by their employers. They seem to believe that once you
            have lost your
            sight you become to a disability into the company or organisation and any many of them have taken an early
            retirement.
            We recognize that the new constitution requires that every institution or organisation should employ at
            least five
            percent. Five percent of the employees should be those with disabilities. We are recognizing then that we
            need to
            equip the persons with disabilities who are our colleges with skills that will make them become as useful as
            they
            have been even if they have been to a lower degree than those in the organisation who are employed. So we
            have started
            advertising ourselves, we have started going around to identify those people who are loosing sight and maybe
            hanging
            out. They do no know what to do. We bring them back; equip them with necessary skills so they can resume
            their
            employment at least.<br>We know we cannot achieve 100 %. It is our duty is to enable the affected
            individuals,
            the employers, at least persons who have some limitations. We are able to perform this way and that is the
            degree.
            We know, a driver may not go back to driving but they can still be utilized, we need them employed in the
            institution,
            doing some other kind of work. But we start to move towards the ghetto, and there is a lot to do in the
            field of
            modern technology, so our concern is to equip all persons with visually impairment particularly with adapted
            technology skills. We know others have trained them before from diverse institutions, do not have the
            computer
            skills. They remain to employ some readers, but we know if they equipped with those skills, access
            information,
            at least much of the information they are required to work with through the computer.</p>

            <div style="width: 70%"><p>Abdallah Nyangalio (Dr) is a blind tailor who had his eyes removed because of
                Trachoma.
                After the operation, he learned how to sew. He even taught his own and the neighbours kids how to make
                suits.
                After making a really nice suit for an arrangement he got famous and wanted to share his knowledge with
                others
                to prevent them from poverty and begging for money. He got in touch with Tanzania Trade Development
                Authority
                (TanTrade) and from them he received three sewing machines. He expanded his business and even employed
                six
                trainees. Listen to the interviews with two of his students, Jamila Mohamed and Philemon William Isaac.

        <p>This course is useful to me given my difficult background.
        It helps me to be able to stand on my own economically. To sustain myself and my family. My future is to open a tailoring office so I can 1.
        Sustain myself and my family. But I can also use that office to train other Tanzanians. Both those with visual impairment and those that are able to see,
        and to follow their career in the future.
