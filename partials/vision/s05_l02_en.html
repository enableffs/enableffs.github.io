        <p>Early intervention can mean both interventions in early years of human life or intervention in early stages
            of visual loss.</p>

        <p>Early intervention is extremely important, the reason is, if it is in children then it is likely possible to
            prepare interventions which may help the child. And if the child is at school, special programs will be
            effective for child development in all domains intellectual, physical, social and emotional.</p>

        <p>And in case the early intervention is to an adult who has just started developing signs of visual
            impairment, there is a possibility to handle the situation. Remember WHO reported that 80% of visual
            impairments can be prevented or cured.</p>
