        <p>Visual impairment refers to a significant functional loss of vision. This functional loss differs from low visual loss to total vision loss. Visual impairment or low vision refers to severe reduction in vision. A person with low visual functional loss has a possibility to see based on refractive corrections. But this is not a case for blindness. Blindness refers to inability to see therefore a blind person is unable to see.</p>
