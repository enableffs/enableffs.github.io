        <p>Visual impairment refers to a significant functional loss of vision. This functional loss differs from low visual loss to total vision loss. Visual impairment or low vision refers to severe reduction in vision.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A person with low visual functional loss has a possibility to see based on refractive corrections.</li>
<li>Blindness refers to inability to see. Therefore a blind person is unable to see.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Causes of visual impairment</h3>
<p>Visual impairment can be caused by various factors including prenatal, neonatal and postnatal factors. It simply causes of visual impairment a person get as a consequences of living style of pregnant mothers which affect the child before birth, another situation may occur during birth especially issues related to infections and accidents or trauma and finally environment factor a person encounter in the surroundings including nutrition, accidents, infections or diseases.</p>
<h4>Two ways of identifying causes of visual impairment</h4>
<p>Professionals have identified causes of visual impairment in different ways. There are those who identified the causes of visual impairment under three categories:</p>
<ul><li>Uncorrected refractive errors including myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism.</li>
<li>Un-operated cataract </li>
<li>Glaucoma</li>
</ul>
<h4>Another way of identifying causes of visual impairment has been basing on the following conditions:</h4>
<ul><li><strong>Cataracts</strong> are congenital and pediatric pathology that describes the greying or opacity of the crystalline lens</li>

<p>In case of adults cataracts is associated with aging. As we age we are likely to experience cataract. There is a possibility of reducing risk to experience cataract by avoiding smoking and extensive exposure to sunlight.</p>

<li><strong>Retinitis pigmentosa</strong> is a group of genetic disorders that affect the retina's ability to respond to light. This inherited disease causes a slow loss of vision.</li>
<!--   Read more about retinitis pigmentosa-->
<p>Retinitis pigmentosa causes permanent changes to your vision, but how much and how quickly can really vary from person to person. These retinal changes can affect your side vision, which makes it harder for you to see in dim light or the dark, and central vision, which causes difficulty with detailed activities such as reading or watching television.</p>

<li><strong>Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)</strong> can occur in a developing fetus of a pregnant woman who has contracted rubella. CRS can cause sensorineural deafness (58% of patients) or eye abnormalities — especially retinopathy, cataract, and microphthalmia (43% of patients).</li>

<li><strong>Usher syndrome</strong> is a relatively rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in any one of 10 genes resulting in a combination of hearing loss and visual impairment, and is a leading cause of deafblindness. Usher syndrome is incurable at present.</li>

<p>Usher syndrome is characterized by hearing loss and a gradual visual impairment. The hearing loss is caused by a defective inner ear, whereas the vision loss results from retinitis pigmentosa (RP).</p>

<li><strong>Malaria</strong> can cause brain haemorrage, although rare. Brain hemorrhage is sometimes associated with severe cerebral malaria (caused by infection with Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly form of malaria). This bleeding in the brain could cause blindness—whether the visual impairment is permanent or not depends on the extent of the bleeding and how much damage it caused.</li>

<li><strong>Corneal opacification</strong> can cause anything from minor irritation to vision problems and even blindness.</li>
<!--   Read more about Corneal opacification-->
<p>The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped area that covers the front of the eye. Light passes through the cornea before reaching the retina in the back of the eye, and so it must remain clear so light can pass through. Injury, infection, and certain eye diseases can cause corneal opacities.</p>

<li><strong>Refractory errors </strong>include myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism (blurred or distorted vision).</li>
<!--   Read more about Refractory errors-->
<p><strong>Myopia</strong> also called ‘nearsightedness’ it is most common refractive error of the eyes.it is a condition in which objects which are close are seen clearly but objects which are farther away seem to be blurred. This condition can be corrected by eyeglasses, or contact glasses. There have been worried whether myopia is inherited, reports show that myopia is not inherited; it is a condition which may be due to excessive reading and doing other close to eyes work. And it ranges from mild moderate to severe conditions. A good thing is myopia can be prevented.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Hyperopia</strong> is also called farsightedness a common type of refractive error where distant objects may be seen more clearly that objects which are near. Therefore for people with hyperopia can see distant object very well by experience problems with objects that are close. Hyperopia is considered to be a common vision problem. It can be corrected by eyeglasses and contact lenses, it is not possible to cure situation just corrected situation only. It is also reported that surgery may reduce dependency to glasses.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Astigmatism</strong> is a common and usually minor condition of the eye that cause blurred or distorted vision. It is a common type of refractive error. The condition in which they eye does not focus light evenly onto the retina.
In case of astigmatism, the following may handle the situation; use of corrected eyeglasses and contact lenses and finally may include refractive surgery. The signs and symptoms of a person with astigmatic include headache, eyestrain, and blurred vision at all distances.</p>
