        <p>Sexuality is one of sensitive topics especially in African context. Students with visual impairment need to
            knowledge about their sexuality. It is important to orient them to biological changes especially during the
            adolescence period. The effect of not providing people with visual impairment knowledge about sexuality may
            lead to more serious problems for example teenage pregnancy. Also important knowledge about hygiene,
            self-awareness, sexual rights and abuse need to discuss with them.</p>
