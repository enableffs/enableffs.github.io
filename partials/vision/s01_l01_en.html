            <p>Vision can simply refer to ability to see which is enabled by the sensory system.
                Sensory system is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory information.

                What the eye sees is what we refer to as sensory information.</p>

            <p>In the process of see the information is processed through a visual system which includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the sense organ (eye)</li>
                <li>the receptors-rods and cones</li>
                <li>the whole process of visual pathways which starts from eye to the brain.</li>
            </ul>
