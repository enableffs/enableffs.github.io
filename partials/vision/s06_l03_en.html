            <p>The first thing I introduce them to and which is very much individualized is the keyboard, because that gets us to
                everything. Everything that a person with visual impairment has to do it has to be done through the keyboard. Maybe
                I didn´t mention that they don´t use the monitor, they also don´t use the mouse, simply because the monitor need
                some visuals so that a learner would be able to check what is displayed. At same way the mouse require some vision
                too, so a learner is able to follow the cursors movements on the screen. But then my learners are not able to see,
                so they don´t have that vision. That is why we even put the monitor off and we don´t use the mouse. But with the
                keyboard we can´t introduce them too fast, so once they have monitored all the keys on the keyboard, they will in
                a weeks time or two, it takes a lot of time there, because that is the very key. Once they are through with that
                now we introduce them to the other parts of the computer and then we get to know more about introduction to
                computers. Then after that I take them the third package, which is introduction to adaptive technology so that
                they are able to understand and appreciate that. They don´t have the vision and they remain to rely on their
                hearing so that they are able to operate the computer normally, just like any other sighted person. Then after
                that the other packages follow like an introduction to Word, because now after they have known how to use the
                keyboard properly, they are been also introduced to the concept of information and communication technology and
                starting up the machine including.</p>

        <h3>Screen readers</h3>
     <p>Through advancement of technology, computers with certain software are now doing different activities that
            can be useful to people with visual impairment. A screen reader is a software application that attempts to identify and interpret what is being displayed on the screen.
            This interpretation is then re-presented to the user with text-to-speech, sound icons, or a Braille output device
            (Source: Wikipedia).<br><br> Jaws is a widely used screen reader but it is a rather expensive tool. Ipads, Ipods, Iphones and
            laptops from Apple have a built-in function in their operative systems called "VoiceOver". Even if Apple-products are
         rather expensive to purchase, the built-in screen reader are free and maybe less expensive than a Windows-computer with Jaws.<br><br>Blind students at Kenyatta University in Nairobi use such devices in their learning process.</p>
