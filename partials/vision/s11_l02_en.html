        <p>A white cane is a major mobility aid for people with visual impairment.
        Many people with visual impairment use it as a mobility tool.</p>
        
    <enable-grey-box e-type="funfact"><p>The first person that used a white cane was James Biggs. 
    He was a British photographer who became blind after an accident. To be more visual he painted his walking stick white.</p> </enable-grey-box>

        <p>Some people use guide dogs instead of white canes. Guide dogs are trained and can navigate various obstacles. 
        However the challenge is that the guide dogs cannot interpret street signs, including traffic lights. 
        Furthermore guide dogs are restricted to some religious organizations. 
        Therefore, it seems difficult for people with visual impairment to be assisted by a dog. </p>

        <p>In African context the use of dog guide is minimal, it also have negative connotation. 
        People are more comfortable when assisted by their friends and family members for social reasons. </p>

        <enable-grey-box e-type="warning"><p>The difference in color have meaning in some countries, for example white canes indicates 
        that the person is blind while green canes indicates a person with low visual loss.</p></enable-grey-box>
