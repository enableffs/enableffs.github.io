        <p>White cane is a major mobility aid for people with visual impairmet.it is used by many people with visual
            impairment. It is a mobility tool. The history shows that white cans were introduced after World War 1;
            James Biggs in 1921 was reported to start his own white cane painted white after he became blind due to
            accident. He painted it white to be more visible.</p>

        <p>Others use guide dogs instead of white canes. Guide dogs are trained and can navigate various obstacles
            however the challenge is the guide dogs cannot interpret street signs including traffic lights red and
            green. Furthermore guide dogs are restricted to some religious organizations; therefore, it seems difficulty
            for people with visual impediment to be assisted by their guide dogs everywhere.
            <br>The difference in color have meaning in some countries, for example white cane painted white will
            indicates the person is blind while green cane indicates the person is with low visual loss.</p>

        <p>In African context the use of dog guide is minimal, it also have negative connotation. People are more
            comfortable when assisted by their friends, family members for social reasons.
