        <p>With braille it is possible to convert different materials into a format that can be accessible by people
            with visual impairment. Either students can also use braille to prepare their work and print in a format
            that is accessible to sighted teachers. Therefore braille can accommodate the needs of visually impaired
            students.</p>
        <p>If affordable it is possible to get braille textbooks, and paperless braille writing devices.</p>
