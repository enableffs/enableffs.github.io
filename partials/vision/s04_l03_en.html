        <p>The most important way of getting to know whether a person has vision problem is through <strong>screening</strong>.</p> 
        <p>This refers to a method of identifying children with visual impairment or eye conditions that are likely to lead
            to visual impairment. The aim of screening is to identify the visual problem. Both children and adults can
            undergo vision screening.</p>

        <ul><li>Neonatal conditions</li>
        <li>Risk factors</li>
