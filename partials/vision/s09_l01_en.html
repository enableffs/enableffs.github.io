        <p>People with visual impairment may need strategies to know where they are and where they want to go. 
        Different strategies may help them to walk safely and orientation and mobility are important.</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>Orientation</strong> refers to the knowledge, skills and ability of a person with visual impairment to be 
        able to know where he is or where he wants to go. Most people with visual impairment can do that by using their 
        remaining senses.</p>

        <p><strong>Mobility</strong> refers to the ability of moving through the environment in a safe and easy way. 
        Mobility devices like a long white cane, dog guides and other electronic travel aids may support the movement. 
        Sometimes, especially to developing countries these devises may be not accessible. Then you can find people guided by others by holding hands. It is also possible to make a long white cane from the local plants around.
        In schools children with visual impairment may have a friend who assists him/her.</p>
