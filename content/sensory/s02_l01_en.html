        <h3>Inclusion and Inclusive Education</h3>
        <p><i>Inclusion</i> is a philosophy which focuses on the process of adjusting the home, the school, and
            the society so that all the individuals, regardless of their differences, can have the opportunity to interact,
            play, learn, work and experience the feeling of belonging. Arising from the philosophy of inclusion, inclusive
            education has emerged. <br><br>
        <h5>Inclusive Education</h5>
        <p>Inclusive education is the practice of education where all learners are in the same school and classes alongside their  peers.
            Learners with different abilities participate fully as equally valued and unique individuals.
            The Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education (1994) is  probably the most significant
            international document that has ever appeared in connection to inclusion in special needs education.
            It argues that:</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote"><p>Regular schools with inclusive orientation are creating welcoming communities, building
            an inclusive society, achieving education for all, and are the most effective means of combating discriminatory
            attitudes.</p></enable-grey-box>

        <br>
        <p>Unesco´s Guidelines for Inclusion (2005) states:</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote"><p>Education must be viewed as facilitative in everyone’s human development and
            functionality, regardless of barriers of any kind, physical or otherwise. Therefore, disability of any kind
            cannot be a disqualifier.</p></enable-grey-box>

    <p>According to these guidelines, four key elements have tended to conceptualize inclusion:</p>
    <ol><li><i>Inclusion is a process.</i><br>Inclusion has to be seen as a never-ending
        search to find better ways of responding to diversity.</li>
        <li><i>Inclusion is concerned with the identification and removal of barriers.</i><br>This means collecting and evaluating information from a wide variety
            of sources in order to plan for improvements in policy and practice.</li>
        <li><i>Inclusion is about the presence, participation and achievement of all learners.</i><br>This implies considering where learners are educated and how
            frequently they attend, the quality of their experiences
            whilst they are there and the outcomes of learning across the curriculum.</li>
        <li><i>Inclusion involves a particular emphasis on those groups of learners who may be at
            risk of marginalization, exclusion or underachievement.</i><br>It´s a moral responsibility to ensure that those groups are carefully
            monitored and that the necessary steps are taken to ensure their participation in education.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>What inclusion <strong>is</strong> about:</h4>
        <enable-grey-box><ul><li>welcoming diversity</li>
            <li>benefiting all learners, not only targeting the excluded</li>
            <li>children in school who may feel excluded</li>
            <li>providing equal access to education or making certain provisions for certain categories of children without excluding them</li>
        </ul></enable-grey-box>

        <enable-audio sound-filename="obstaclesshort.mp3"></enable-audio>
        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><p>I may not say that inclusive education has totally failed in
            Uganda, but I think it was not planned for by government when it was being taken up. I think they just took
            it haphazardly without preparing for it. For example, we have very many blind children here who are brought from inclusive
            schools, where a child was taken up by a school and attended primary one to primary seven, and eventually when he or
            she reaches primary seven, she cannot be allowed to sit her primary leaving examination because through out her primary
            school, she has not learned how to read and write Braille for example.  In the school where such a child is, the
            teachers don´t know Braille. The teachers don´t have equipment, for example slate and stylus and braille paper. So
            instead of teaching a child how to read and write and maybe how to do mathematics in a Braille format, they just
            teach them verbally and the child learns by memory. By the time the child reaches primary seven, because he or
            she has been answering questions verbally, and being questioned verbally, and the child answers verbally while the
            teacher writes for him or her the answers, he/she will not be competent in Braille. When the child has reached primary seven the examiners
            don´t allow something like that to happen. That´s the biggest disadvantage in an inclusive setting in Uganda. So by the
            time the child is brought back here at the primary level, we take back the child to primary five to learn Braille,
            and those are many years lost, which is a very big inconvenience to a child.</p></enable-read-more>
        <br><br>
        <p>The headmaster at the school for the blind has a reflected view on the pros and cons of inclusion. He sees some
            advantages with special schools for the blind. These include giving time to and focusing on, for example,
            activities for daily living (ADL) and mobility. However, he also knows the disadvantages with that kind of segregation.</p>




        <p>Even if declarations are signed and professional and political will is present, it takes a long
            time before implementation takes place. This is also the case with inclusion. Occasionally,
            such processes completely stop, and sometimes authorities find it easier-to-win solutions.
            <br><br>However, it is important to be aware that inclusion <strong>is not</strong>: </p>

        <enable-grey-box><ul><li>reforms of special education alone, but reform of both the formal and non-formal education system</li>
            <li>responding only to diversity, but also improving the quality of education for all learners</li>
            <li>promoting special schools but perhaps additional support to  learners within the regular school system</li>
            <li>meeting the needs of children with disabilities only</li>
            <li>meeting one child’s needs at the expense of another child</li>
        </ul></enable-grey-box>

        <p>Francis Kinubi also sees some disadvantages of special schools</p>
        <enable-audio sound-filename="disadvantages.mp3"></enable-audio>
        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><p>I think the biggest disadvantage I can say is not sharing with
            their sighted counterparts, whom they were sharing with when they were still in the previous school, where they were
            learning together side by side the sighted children. So previously when they were in the mainstream schools they were
            making friends with the sighted children, the sighted children could read for them, and when it was time for sports,
            sighted children would be the ones to guide them during athletic championships. And the teachers themselves in that particular school
            were also getting used to blind children, which they were not used to before. That is the disadvantage,
            that our children missing that relationship, that kind of socialization with the sighted children in that school.

        <h3>Segregation</h3>
        <p>Segregation is when the learners are in a special school or institutions where the other learners have the same or
            other disabilities.  In such segregated educational settings, the learners often tend to live a separate life from
            the life in the community.</p>
        <h3>Integration</h3>
        <p>There is a step between segregation and inclusion, and that is integration.</p>
        <p>Integration is when the learner is being placed in
            mainstream education settings with some adaptations and resources. The structures are pre-existing and the attitude
            are not changed.</p>

        <p>Source: <enable-link href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001402/140224e.pdf">Unesco´s Guidelines for Inclusion</enable-link>. The illustration above is modified.</p
        <br>
        <h3>The situation for inclusion in the three East African countries:</h3>
<h4>Uganda</h4>
        <p>The policy and practice of inclusion in Uganda was introduced as a result of the universal primary
            education (UPE) policy which was put in place in 1997. The UPE policy was implemented in a way that
            government undertakes to provide free education for four children in each family,
            and priority was given to children with disabilities.<br>
            Many children with disabilities and other special learning needs now benefit from the policy of inclusive
            education. <br>However, some challenges are being experienced in an attempt to meet the needs of these
            children and they include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Few teachers who have training in special needs education in the ordinary schools.</li>
            <li>Inadequate adapted teaching and learning materials for children with disabilities in the schools.</li>
            <li>Environment which is not conducive for some children.</li>
            <li>Negative attitude by some teachers and school employees towards inclusion.</li>
            <li>Large numbers of children in the ordinary classes which makes it difficult to meet individual
                learning needs.</li>
            <li>Parents cannot provide school requirements for their children due to poverty or negative attitudes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Special Schools</h5>
        <p>Special schools enroll only one category of children with disabilities. In Uganda, in spite of the policy
            of inclusion, some children with severe challenges such as deaf children, children with multiple
            impairments are enrolled in special schools. The children in such schools follow the ordinary
            school curriculum but with some modifications that are meant to enhance their participation in learning.</p>
        <h4>Kenya</h4>


            <br><p>Kenya in
            recognizing the rights to education for persons with disabilities has put in place national laws and policies to
            guide the practice. They include:</p>
        <ul><li> Sector Policy for Learners and Trainees with Disabilities 2018</li>
            <li>The Basic Education Act 2013</li>
            <li> The Kenya Constitution 2010</li>

            <li>Persons with Disabilities Act 2003</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The idea of inclusive education has been embraced in Kenya as outlined in Sector Policy for Learners and Trainees with Disabilities 2018.
            Hence the Ministry of Education in Kenya is committed to recognizing and reinforcing inclusive education as one of
            the means for children with special needs to access education.
            Some children with mild disabilities and special needs are enrolled in regular schools in Kenya. However many with
            disabilities learn in special schools and others in schools practicing integration. Efforts have been made to adapt the
            curriculum for learners with disabilities thus enabling their participation in learning. However, some learners with
            disabilities are able to follow the regular school curriculum. <br><br>As Kenya moves towards inclusion there are challenges
            that need to be addressed. They include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>General attitudes of community including teachers towards inclusive education</li>
            <li>Arising from multiplicity of disabilities teachers trained in specific skill areas of disability are in short supply</li>
            <li>Inadequate teaching and learning resources</li>
        </ul>



     <h4>Tanzania</h4>
     <p>Tanzania is fully aware of the need for all children (and all Tanzanians) to have access to education. This awareness is also enshrined in the Constitution – 1977 Cap 11 (2) which
        provides for the right to education by all Tanzanians, regardless of their age, disability, sex, and so forth. Likewise, Tanzania is signatory to international agreements such as the
         goal of Education for All and that of Universal Primary Education. </p>
     <p>In March 2009 Tanzania produced its National Strategy on Inclusive Education 2009-2017. The Strategy aims to identify and eradicate all
       the barriers to presence, participation, and learning that learners, teachers and parents/guardians may experience.
       The barriers include impairment,
       psycho-social disturbances, life experiences, environment, and curriculum and teaching, among others.</p>
     <p>Using the Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (TESSA) toolkit, and with support from UNESCO, Tanzania has already prepared a series of booklets on providing tools to teachers,
        learners, and the communities for them to understand and be to accommodate inclusive education.</p>
        <h4>Why is it that some children with disabilities do not have access to education?</h4>
        <p>In spite of the above educational provisions, some children with disabilities in East Africa do not have access to education due to several reasons which may
            include:</p>
        <ul><li>Poverty: Some parents may not afford to pay tuition fees required by schools or provide assistive devices needed by the children.</li>
            <li>Negative attitudes: Some children are hidden in the homes or overprotected by their parents/guardians, thus limiting their opportunity to learn, participate and develop.</li>
            <li>Health conditions such as HIV/AIDS hinder the child’s regular attendance, or without early identification and treatment may result into impairment of vision, hearing or multisensory difficulties.</li>
            <li>Long distance from home to the school may affect their mobility.</li>
        </ul>
