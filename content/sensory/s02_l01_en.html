        <h3>Inclusion</h3>
        <p>Inclusion is the practice of educating where all learners are in the same school and classes alongside their  peers.
            Learners with different abilities participate fully as equally valued and unique individuals.
            The Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education (1994) is  probably the most significant
            international document that has ever appeared in connection to special needs education.
            It argues that:</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote"><p>Regular schools with inclusive orientation are creating welcoming communities, building
            an inclusive society, achieving education for all, and are the most effective means of combating discriminatory
            attitudes.</p></enable-grey-box>

        <br>
        <p>Unesco´s Guidelines for Inclusion (2005) states:</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote"><p>Education must be viewed as facilitative in everyone’s human development and
            functionality, regardless of barriers of any kind, physical or otherwise. Therefore, disability of any kind
            cannot be a disqualifier.</p></enable-grey-box>

    <p>According to these guidelines, four key elements have tended to conceptualize inclusion:</p>
    <ol><li><i>Inclusion is a process.</i><br>Inclusion has to be seen as a never-ending
        search to find better ways of responding to diversity.</li>
        <li><i>Inclusion is concerned with the identification and removal of barriers.</i><br>Collecting and evaluating information from a wide variety
            of sources in order to plan for improvements in policy and practice.</li>
        <li><i>Inclusion is about the presence, participation and achievement of all students.</i><br>Where children are educated and how punctually they attend, the quality of their experiences
            whilst they are there and the outcomes of learning across the curriculum.</li>
        <li><i>Inclusion involves a particular emphasis on those groups of learners who may be at
            risk of marginalization, exclusion or underachievement.</i><br>It´s a moral responsibility to ensure that those groups are carefully
            monitored and that the necessary steps are taken.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>What inclusion <strong>is</strong> about:</h4>
        <enable-grey-box><ul><li>welcoming diversity</li>
            <li>benefiting all learners, not only targeting the excluded</li>
            <li>children in school who may feel excluded</li>
            <li>providing equal access to education or making certain provisions for certain categories of children without excluding them</li>
        </ul></enable-grey-box>

                Francis Kanubi is the headmaster at a special school for the blind near Kampala in Uganda.

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><p>I may not say that inclusive education has totally failed in
            Uganda, but I think it was not planned for by government when it was been taken up. I think they just took it up
            hazardly without preparing for it. For example, we have very many blind children here who are brought from inclusive
            schools, where a child was taken up by a school and attended primary one to primary seven, and eventually when he or
            she reach primary seven, she cannot be allowed to sit her primary leaving examination because through her primary
            school, she has not learned how to read and write, - Braille for example.  In the school where such a school is the
            teacher don´t know Braille. The teachers don´t have equipment, for example slate, for example braille paper. So
            instead of learning a child how to read and write and maybe how to do mathematics in a Braille format, they just
            teach them verbally and the child learns by memory. And by the time the child reach primary seven, because he or
            she has been answering questions verbally, and being questioned verbally, and the child answers verbally, and the
            teacher write for him or her the answers the child has given. When the child has reached primary seven the examiners
            don´t allow something like that happen. That´s the biggest disadvantages in an inclusive setting in Uganda. So by the
            time the child is brought back here at the primary level, we take back the child to primary five to learn Braille,
            and those are many years lost, which is a very big inconvenience to a child.</p></enable-read-more>

        <p>The headmaster at the school for the blind has a reflected view on the pros and cons of inclusion. He sees some
            advantages with special schools for the blind. These include giving time to and focusing on, for example,
            activities for daily living (ADL) and mobility. However, he also knows the disadvantages with that kind of segregation.</p>

        <h3>Segregation</h3>
        <p>Segregation is when the learners are in a special school or institutions where the other learners have the same or
            other difficulties.  In such segregated educational settings, he learners often tend to live a separate life from
            the life outside school</p>
        <p>The situation for inclusion in the three of the East African countries:(add content from each of the three East
            African countries)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uganda</li>
            <li>Kenya</li>
            <li>Tanzania</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Even if declarations are signed and professional and political will is present, it takes a long
            time before implementation takes place. This is also the case with inclusion. Occasionally, such processes completely stop, and sometimes authorities find more easy-to-win solutions.
            <br><br>However, it is important to be aware that inclusion <strong>is not</strong>: </p>

        <enable-grey-box><ul><li>reforms of special education alone, but reform of both the formal and non-formal education system</li>
            <li>responding only to diversity, but also improving the quality of education for all learners</li>
            <li>special schools but perhaps additional support to students within the regular school system</li>
            <li>meeting the needs of children with disabilities only</li>
            <li>meeting one child’s needs at the expense of another child</li>
        </ul></enable-grey-box>

        <p>Francis Kanubi also sees some disadvantages of inclusion</p>
        <enable-audio sound-filename="disadvantages.mp3"></enable-audio>
        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><p>I think the biggest disadvantage I can say is not sharing with
            their sighted counterparts, whom they were sharing with when they were still in the previous school, where they were
            learning together side by side the sighted children. So previously when they were in the mainstream schools they were
            making friends with the sighted children, the sighted children could read for them, and when it was time for sports,
            sighted children would be the ones to guide them to athletic championships. And the teachers in that particular school
            where also getting used to blind children, which they were note used to before. So that is the biggest disadvantages,
            that our children missing that relationship, that kind of socialization with the sighted children in that school.

        <h3>Integration</h3>
        <p>What about a step between inclusion and segregation, integration?</p>
        <p>Integration is when the learner is being placed in
            mainstream education settings with some adaptations and resources. The structures are pre-existing and the attitudes
            are not changed.</p>
