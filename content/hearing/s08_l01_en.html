        <h3>Hearing aids</h3>
        <p>Hearing aids are sophisticated audio amplifiers which, to some extent, can compensate for hearing loss. There are many types of hearing aids, some worn
            on the body, others placed in the ear canal, while others placed behind the ear.</p>

    <p>The hearing aid amplifies all sounds, but emphasizes the sounds that the user has difficulty perceiving. However the sounds emanating from the hearing aid is not
        as clearl as the sounds a person with normal hearing experience. Therefore, hearing aid users should get used to the sound image from the instrument and
        learn how to interpret this.</p>

    <enable-grey-box ><h4>Since hearing loss is different and is compensated
        differently, the sound experienced will be different for each indidual.</h4></enable-grey-box>
        <h4>How hearing aids are used?</h4>

    <p>Since hearing loss is individual, a hearing aid must be adapted to each user. Even if a hearing aid will not provide the normal hearing function, many "Hard of
        hearing"- people will have great need of a hearing aid. Since the user of a hearing aid must learn to listen in a new way, it takes time to adjust to using a
        hearing aid. A hearing aid will amplify sounds which she/he has not heard in a long time or maybe never heard. In the beginning, it is recommended that the
        person become familiar with the daily sounds and where they come from. Initially, the sounds could be heard unfamiliar, but the user will gradually get used
        to them.</p>
        <p>By talking or reading aloud to himself one becomes accustomed to his/her own voice. Eventually the person needs to go to quiet places, outside the
            home - a park or forest and listen to the sounds there. Places with background noise should be avoided, for it can be experienced very noisy at first.</p>
