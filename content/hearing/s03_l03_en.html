<enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Half of all cases of hearing loss can be prevented through primary prevention.</enable-quotebox>
 <h3>Some simple strategies for prevention include:</h3>
<ul><li>Immunizing children against childhood diseases, including measles, meningitis, rubella and mumps;</li>
<li>Immunizing adolescent girls and women of reproductive age against rubella before pregnancy;</li>
<li>Screening for and treating syphilis and other infections in pregnant women;</li>
<li>Improving antenatal and perinatal care, including promotion of safe childbirth;</li>
<li>Following healthy ear care practices;</li>
<li>Screening of children for otitis media, followed by appropriate medical interventions;</li>
<li>Avoiding the use of particular drugs which may be harmful to hearing, unless prescribed and monitored by a qualified physician;</li>
<li>Referring infants at high risk, such as those with a family history of deafness or those born with low birth weight, birth asphyxia, jaundice or meningitis, for early assessment of hearing, prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, as required;</li>
<li>Reducing exposure (both occupational and recreational) to loud sounds by raising awareness about the risks; developing and enforcing relevant legislation; and encouraging individuals to use personal protective devices such as earplugs and noise-cancelling earphones and headphones.</li>
</ul>
