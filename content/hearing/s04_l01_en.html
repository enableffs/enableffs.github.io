        <h3>Right to education</h3>
        <p>Children with hearing impairment need and have a right to education. At present many children with hearing impairment
            do not have that opportunity. Parents, teachers and other stakeholders should ensure that these children access and
            participate in education.</p>
        <enable-quick-question e-question="Did you know...?"
                               e-answer="Did you know that although education is now a right,
                               many hearing impaired children are not enrolled for the primary education?"></enable-quick-question>
        <p>Many deaf children are not offered formal education. How will their future be?</p>
        <h4>Different forms of educational provision</h4>
        <p>The society becomes more and more independent if citizens are well educated.  Hearing-impaired citizens who are
            educated are a resource for the community which can be utilized for national development. There are different forms
            of schooling that have been established for deaf children.<br><br>Educational provision for children with hearing
            impairment can be grouped in the following categories <strong>“special schooling”</strong>, <strong>“special units in mainstream schools” </strong>
            and <strong>“inclusive education”</strong>. Each of them has some advantages and some disadvantages.</p>

        <p><strong>"Special schools"</strong> are segregated schools only for deaf children. They have either day or boarding provisions.
        </p>
        <enable-read-more label="Some advantages and disadvantages of segregated schools">
            <p>Advantages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The children have other deaf children to play with and to learn with.</li>
                        <li>There are more teachers and a bigger range of subjects and skills can be taught.</li>
                        <li>There may be more specialist equipment and books available.</li>
                        <li>Often there are deaf adults doing many of the other jobs in the school – cleaning, cooking,
                            house-parenting and hence become role models to the children.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is likely that they will have many deaf friends when they leave school.</li>
                        <li>They have no difficulty in communicating with each other outside lesson times.</li>
                        <li>There is no danger of the children feeling the isolation that deaf children often feel if
                            they are with people who have difficulty in communicating with them.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

             <p>Disadvantages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The children may not learn how to live in society with many different people. They may find
                            it hard to settle after they leave school and their friends.
                        </li>
                        <li>Residential schools are very costly. In many countries it is too expensive to build enough
                            schools for all the deaf children.
                        </li>
                        <li>Parents may find it expensive to take the children home for the holidays and take them
                            back when the term starts. They may be tempted to leave the children at school without visiting
                            them.
                        </li>
                        <li>The children may lose touch with their families.</li>
                        <li>The children do not often meet hearing children</li>
                        <li>The children may miss the activities of school during the holidays. They may not have
                            friends in the local community.
                        </li>

                    </ul>

        </enable-read-more>



        <p>When the deaf children are placed in a class of hearing children it is usually called
            <strong>“mainstreaming”</strong>.
            This is a placement with difficulties unless there is some special help and attention for the deaf child.
        </p>
        <enable-read-more label="Some disadvantages of mainstream schools">

            <ul>
                <li>The child may not understand what the teacher is saying and doing.</li>

        <p>At "Nancy Comprehensive Secondary School for the Deaf" the deaf and hearing  learners are studying together in
            an inclusive class. The  learners learn both academic and vocational skills and the  learners who are hearing

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview">
            <p>"We started this with some few parents, a group of parents who come together is called PADECA-(
                parents of Deaf Children Association). They came together to form a group to see a way of training their children. After
                seeing
                their children learning here from primary level up to seven, there were
                no way they could go. They decided to at least, get away of catering them in vocational skills, training
                skills. That is why in
                2004 we open this vocational section, with carpentry,brogling (bricklaying?) and tailoring.<br><br>
                The best thing we need here is communication which is sign language.
                We intend to bring all the parents with their
                children to train them in sign language so that communication can be easier. Here we teach the teacher
                and the child and the
                child and the parent.<br><br>These teachers we have here, not all of them are trained in special needs
                education. But we
                endeavor, let me put it right, every Wednesday we converge  here for sign language training for
                everybody when wishes,
                newcomers and their parents to acquire sign language training. For that, when this children, they are
                very many who have graduated
                from here –from that level of craft. But I have to tell you that when I move out even in town, when I
                come across them in the
                workshops, they are living some better life as compared when they were living earlier back home. They
                are living their own life,
                at least something can give some for daily living.<br><br>
                The comparison between the hearing and the deaf, in the beginning it was difficult, but now that he way
                of communication is
                easier, the cooperation is now becoming perfect in the sense that even the hearing themselves who have joined
                here, are
                now helping us as interpreters. Because they can hear and they can sign. So it is making learning here
                almost becoming perfect. "</p></enable-read-more>

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview">
            <h4>About Rose</h4>

            <p>Rose is one of our girls here. She came here in class one and we realized that she was hearing impaired
                when she
                was brought. We had to take her historical background then after that she was given the right
                placement in
                class one where she interacted with the other learners. Through difficulty madam Rose managed to have
                Selena  as her
                interpreter. Madam used to  interpret a little bit and then she decided to give her a peer, at least a child of her age
                that could help her with interpretation.  So we discovered that children learn faster than
                the elders.
                And they went together to class two until now. She never repeated a class. Every year she is promoted to
                next level and now she is in grade eight.</p>
            <h4>How is it to have a hearing impaired child in the class?</h4>
            <p>No it is okay because at least it is a way of enabling the community members to communicate with. You
                know
                children are acters or agents of change and by having a such a child in class here. When they meet other
                children
                who also are hearing impaired, at least they can communicate to them because I always discovered that
                most of
                these special need children, they kind of feel withdrawn because they dont have friends around. But the
                fact
                that we have them here at school have enabled other community members to accept them. Even the parents
                who used
                to hide their children at home are now coming to us and requesting to put the children in school. We
                even have
                worse cases and other cases. From at least we are going to meet these children, we are getting to be with
                them.
                They are being accepted by the community members, they are being accepted by their parents and the
                entire
                community, even the teachers who are not trained.</p>
            <h4>What about the other children?</h4>
            <p>They do communicate, but not as much as Selene does. You know everything is developing interest. And
                Selene
                because she have been trained at that earlier level. The others equally can only communicate with her,
                not as
                fluent as Selene does, but at least the normal way of communication with deaf. When Selene is not around
                at
                least she finds a few she can interact with. Well they stay two worlds apart, Selene stays down, down, down. And
                she
                stays the other side.<br>
                When she going home she moves with the others who are not Selene, and Selene also moves to the other
                child.</p>
            <p>Disadvantages for the interpreter
                The only disadvantages we really talked to her about is when she interprets she does not want to move her
                lips. She finds difficulty in moving her lips. I think when she started
                doing it, maybe that was were there was some faults.
                Maybe the teacher didnt train her to move her lips, and maybe by training and coming up she will be
                used to just doing it the way the other girl will also do it. But otherwise we have always tried to
                talk to her every day about moving her lips. But it is a bit difficult interpreting the teacher is
                teaching, you also want to get into whatever you been taught. But she does it perfectly and she performs
                very well in class. </p>
                <h4> Is it good for the girl to be an interpreter?</h4>
                <p>She don´t loose her friends, she still have a friend. The one she moves with to her home. The one she
                plays around with here in school. But they really dont walk together the two of them. If you go outside
                there you will find her mingling with her class members together. And she does what she does.
                She does her homework, she does everything like any other child, no special treatment.</p>
            <h4>Is the interpreter volunteer or pushed into it?</h4>
            <p>When Sofie came to school they used to sit together and they were friends. And you know for those
                young children making friendship something that is quite easy. So because of that, the
                Madam introduced her into it, because she used to fumble a lot. Madam would see her trying to  sign a lot
                for her. Like now we have a deaf boy who came last year and you know in that class we still dont have so
                many who can interpret. But you find that nobody has pushed anybody. They just want to come out
                individually, to help him, to help this particular boy. They want him to be associated with that
                particular hearing impaired boy.</p>

            <h4>Is this a way of handling the situation you will recommend?</h4>
            <p>I wish we had interpreters who are paid. I wish we would have, but by us having such an interpreter, it
                mean that this child would only communicate with the interpreter. What about the peers? These
                children have to learn with their peers, they have to grow up together, they have to fight, they have to
                play, they have to do everything together. Supposing you employ me am interpreter at my age and such a
                young child. You know, it wouldn´t really be. If he does it with a peer i think it is so much better than doing
                it with somebody who is not at their age.</p>

            <h4>How do you help learners who are deaf?</h4>
            <p>Normally, like you can see that we already have a challenge. I told you we have a number of
                teachers who are trained in special needs. All of us did inclusive and in inclusive, we have almost all
                the areas that we covered. So we have those who have developed an interest, like in this situation madam who
                has developed interest in sign language. And at her free time during games she calls Sofie and even us, we call
                her and talk to her and give her extra work that may be she didn't get during class time. It has to be done. But
                for class work time she has to do.</p>

            <h4>What will happen when they complete class eight?</h4>
            <p>We are worried about that. We are worried about that and we are even thinking of them going to the same
                school. But the problem is: Yes they will go to the same school – what about the there after? That
                is the main worry. We handle this till like we handled before. They completed class eight, after that,
                there is nobody to pick up from there. And some of us wish we should be secondary teachers too. We bring
                those children, bring them back to school and may be we should start up a vocational training center. We long for
                that. So the such children who complete, we bring them here. We even had a visually impaired girl
                who performed very well. She went to Ahero Girls unfortunately somewhere in between somebody
                impregnated her and she disappeared. She dropped out of school. </p>
                <h4> Do Selene and Sofie normally stay together?</h4>

                <p><br>They are normally separated. When during holidays they are never together. And we can find other
                days where they are never together. So during this time when they are not together, they are both living
                their own lives. That is the headache. May be a boarding school were we don´t go home. So they are already
                that. There are times where they are not together. So our worry is after class eight. That is our worry.
                <br>But to me I wouldn´t mind if maybe Sofie goes to a special school at that level. Because already
                at her tender age she has come up in an inclusive set up.
                So at that age maybe for one up to form four. If she goes to maybe a special school she still will be
                accepted by the community because she is grown up with them. My only worry is if she
                drops out of that level. For what´s next after dropping out. Is she going to be a mother and be living
                in a terrible community where some people are misusing such a young girl.</p>

        <h4>The importance of sign language</h4>
        <p>Sign language is important in the education of children with hearing impairment. They should therefore be supported to learn
            this language. Uganda school for the deaf is a special school where the pupils learn sign language as their mother tongue and
            English or other local language as their second language.  It is impossible to use sign language with
            spoken language simultaneously; that is
            why sign language is still a challenge to the learners' education and parents'.</p>
        <h4>Examination provisions</h4>
        <p>The current National Primary Examination in Uganda and Kenya demands the Deaf to be fluent in English before
            they are graded in a
            given subject, which situation ignores the fact that, learning any second language is influenced by ones
            mother tongue.</p>
        <p>In their examination regulations "The Uganda National Examinations Board" allows deaf candidates to be guided
            by sign language
            interpreters and readers who are expected to interpret or voice record candidates responses.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, as a result, majority of the
            deaf adolescents end up failing exams and eventually dropping out of school.</p>
