        <p>The Uganda School for the Deaf offers primary education with pre-vocation skills in carpentry, tailoring,
            home sciences, and agricultural practice for students who don't fit well in the academic classes.<br> One
            intention of the pre-vocation training is to give them skills for further vocational training so the
            students can get employment in the future.</p>

            domestic chores, but not the deaf child. The result is that deaf children lack skills i domestic chores.The
            students in this video learn to make sandwiches.<br>They can maybe make an income by selling sandwiches?</p>
