        <h3>Family is important</h3>

        <p>Families play a major role in the development of their children, but for deaf children they are even more
            important. Families can make huge impact on their own children’s lives and also change the situation for
            other deaf children in their community. They can do this by working together with service providers, or
            through self-help initiatives. There is no question that parents power has a huge role to play in improving
            deaf children’s lives! </p>

        <p>There are some huge challenges – made even greater by poverty – which can discourage parents from engaging
            with their children. Sometimes, practitioners comment that families feel as though they have nothing to
            contribute to their children’s development, or that it can take a long time for some families to see the
            benefits of getting involved actively in their child’s life. </p>

        <p>Families often don’t know how they can make a difference to their children. Sometimes they need emotional
            support to help them take more responsibility for their children. Most parents know very little about deafness
            when their deaf children are born.</p>
            <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Over 90% of deaf children are born into families with no experience of
                deafness</enable-quotebox>
            <p>Parents may feel ashamed, since negative attitudes about deafness and disability are common. And
            often parents have no way of finding out about language and communication, education, social and emotional
            issues, or the deaf community.</p>


        <p>This lack of accurate information often prevents families from seeking advice. Other family members,
            community members or even professionals may dismiss concerns about a child’s hearing. </p>

        <h4>Deaf role models</h4>
        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Deaf people are a vital part of a deaf child's community</enable-quotebox>

        <p>Deaf adults can be excellent role models. By drawing on their own experiences, they can show families that
            deafness does not need to be a barrier to achievement. Parents and teachers should invite deaf role models
            to interact with children with hearing impairment as this may encourage them to gain confidence.</p>
