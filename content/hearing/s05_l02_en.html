            <div style="width: 45%"><p>Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages have been developed. A
                common misconception is that all sign languages are the same worldwide.<br><br>Each country generally has its
                own, native sign language, and some have more than one.<br> Inside Kenya there are some dialect differences
                between Kisumu and Mombasa. At the same time, sign languages may share similarities to each other.<br><br>
                Here are some of the letters in Kenyan Sign Language which is used by over half of the country's
                estimated 600,000 deaf population.</p></div>

        <enable-read-more label="Read his story">


            <p>I was born in Uganda at a time when education for the deaf still was at a low level. My mother wanted
                me
                to have a good education so I was sent to Kenya to live with my uncle and to attend a school were I
                was
                thought sign language. So my first language was sign language. But still it was really difficult for
                me
                to communicate with my family and other hearing persons, because they did not know sign language. I
                continued to work hard, and my mother helped me to learn to read and write English. However the
                communication with hearing people still was really difficult, as it was for many other deaf people
                in
                Uganda.</p>

            <h4>The key that opened our doors</h4>

            <p>In the 1990’s a group of deaf people started an advocacy to improve their lives and Uganda National
                Association for the Deaf grew bigger. At about this time sign language was recognized as a language
                in
                the constitution, which was really important for the deaf community. This also meant that sign
                language
                was accepted in schools. To have an own language made it easier to communicate, and it also made
                deaf
                people feel proud. </p>

            <h4><i>"The hearing community and the deaf community came together though an
                interpreter" </i></h4>


            <p>Even though the communication became easier between deaf people with an own language, it was still
                some challenges communicating with the hearing. And when I met Prossy (Proscovia Suubi Nantongo,
                Lecturer, Kyambogo University) and started to teach her sign language and to interpret it was a real
                breakthrough. Using her as an interpreter made it so much easier to communicate with the hearing. So
                the association continued to carrying out programs and demanding services for the deaf. And when
                using interpreters the work was less difficult.</p>

            <h3>My advices for deaf people</h3>

            <p>I was lucky to have a mother who gave me the support and the opportunity to have so much education.
                In 2012 I was the first deaf African to finish my PhD in linguistics. But I met a lot of challenges
                on my way. </p>

            <p>My advice is to work hard and be patient. You have to work hard and look for channels were you would
                attend something that will make you better. Sometimes it is difficult, but if you have a goal you
                can achieve it. So many things can come your way, and prevent you from achieving your goal, but I
                had my family and council, and I asked for help on my way. And here I am now, achieving my goal.</p>

            <p>Secondly, some deaf people are born with hearing parents. They have some other challenges, and some
                won’t accept their deaf child. I think the number one thing is acceptance! And also parents learning
                sign language is very important. </p>

            <p>My experience is that I can’t communicate very well with my father because he doesn’t now sign
                language. I always have to look for an interpreter to communicate with him. </p>

            <p>I urge parent to learn sign language so they can talk to their children. It’s so much easier to
                communicate with the same language.</p>

        <h4>The development of sign language in Tanzania </h4>
        <p>The development of sign language in Tanzania is a quite different story than the development of sign
            language in Uganda. In Tanzania sign language is not the main way of communicate. How come?</p>

<p>Listen to the interview with Thomas Elias Shayo:</p>
<enable-audio sndid="thomas"></enable-audio>
                <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview">
                    <p>It is historical. In Tanzania, education for the deaf has been provided by NGOs and churches
                        from way back in 1960s. So the first school for the deaf which was supported from the
                        roman-catholic church in Tabora region, was teaching the student in the speech, we call it
                        oralism. So the deaf students were told to speech, were forced to be able to speech to
                        become normal. And the philosophy behind it was that; signing is not good for deaf people,
                        because if they sign other people will not understand them. Their families will
                        not understand them, so the church decided that the best way to teach them to speech, but
                        unfortunately they could not teach them to hear. And that is a big problem.</p>
                    <p> We face challenges because deafness in East-African countries is not inherited. Deafness
                           comes by disease. Most of the deaf cases in Tanzania are by disease, like meningitis,
                           malaria and other things. If there are only one deaf person in a family of lets say
                           ten-twenty people, this deaf person become isolated. Now, sign language is the best way, but
                           who will teach sign language to all this family members so they can communicate with this one
                           person. It looks like a very big  drawback, very expensive. So when this deaf child goes to
                           school so it natural when they meet and they understand that we are all deaf, they start
                           signing. But their signing is not standardized, it depends on the school. We use to
                           have ten schools for the deaf in the whole country with a population of almost
                           fifty millions.<br> But not it is changing because the government is opening up small
                           units in all primary schools, many primary schools. At least we are having some
                           deaf communities in these schools and they develop their own signing because there is no
                           one to teach them sign language, there is no one to copy from. So we have a diverse
                           vocabulary of signing from all over the country. Sign language is a problem, it is the
                           best way for the deaf, but it a problem; where do you go to learn sign language?</p>
                    <p>The thing is, there are no qualified interpreters in Tanzania because there is no place, no
                        college in this country where you can go and get an bachelor in sign language or even a
                        diploma or even a certificate. </p>
