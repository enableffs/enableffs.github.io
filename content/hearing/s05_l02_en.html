        <h2>What is sign language?</h2>
        <enable-grey-box><p>Sign language is a visual and gestural language based on the use of hands, eyes, face, mouth and
          body.</p> </enable-grey-box>
          <p>Here are some of the letters in Kenyan Sign Language which is used by over half of the country's
          estimated 600,000 deaf population.</p>

        <p>Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages have been developed. A
                common misconception is that all sign languages are the same worldwide.Each country generally has its
                own, native sign language, and some have more than one.<br><br>In Kenya for instance, there are some dialect differences
                between Kisumu and Mombasa. At the same time, sign languages may share similarities to each other.<br><br>
                </p>

        <h4>The development of sign language in Uganda</h4>
        <p>The development of sign in Uganda stems from the coopration between Kyambogo University and Uganda National Association of the Deaf.
        The two Institutions coraborated in training teachers and other people in sign language. The training is supported by the development
      of the sign language manual and Uganda Sign Language Dictionary</p>

        <enable-read-more label="Read his story">


            <p>I was born in Uganda at a time when education for the deaf still was at a low level. My mother wanted
                me
                to have a good education so I was sent to Kenya to live with my uncle and to attend a school were I
                was
                thought sign language. So my first language was sign language. But still it was really difficult for
                me
                to communicate with my family and other hearing persons, because they did not know sign language. I
                continued to work hard, and my mother helped me to learn to read and write English. However the
                communication with hearing people still was really difficult, as it was for many other deaf people
                in
                Uganda.</p>

            <h4>The key that opened our doors</h4>

            <p>In the 1990’s a group of deaf people started an advocacy to improve their lives and Uganda National
                Association for the Deaf grew bigger. At about this time sign language was recognized as a language
                in
                the constitution, which was really important for the deaf community. This also meant that sign
                language
                was accepted in schools. To have an own language made it easier to communicate, and it also made
                deaf
                people feel proud. </p>

            <h4><i>"The hearing community and the deaf community came together though an
                interpreter" </i></h4>


            <p>Even though the communication became easier between deaf people with an own language, it was still
                some challenges communicating with the hearing. And when I met Prossy (Proscovia Suubi Nantongo,
                Lecturer, Kyambogo University) and started to teach her sign language and to interpret it was a real
                breakthrough. Using her as an interpreter made it so much easier to communicate with the hearing. So
                the association continued to carrying out programs and demanding services for the deaf. And when
                using interpreters the work was less difficult.</p>

            <h3>My advices for deaf people</h3>

            <p>I was lucky to have a mother who gave me the support and the opportunity to have so much education.
                In 2012 I was the first deaf African to finish my PhD in linguistics. But I met a lot of challenges
                on my way. </p>

            <p>My advice is to work hard and be patient. You have to work hard and look for channels were you would
                attend something that will make you better. Sometimes it is difficult, but if you have a goal you
                can achieve it. So many things can come your way, and prevent you from achieving your goal, but I
                had my family and council, and I asked for help on my way. And here I am now, achieving my goal.</p>

            <p>Secondly, some deaf people are born with hearing parents. They have some other challenges, and some
                won’t accept their deaf child. I think the number one thing is acceptance! And also parents learning
                sign language is very important. </p>

            <p>My experience is that I can’t communicate very well with my father because he doesn’t now sign
                language. I always have to look for an interpreter to communicate with him. </p>

            <p>I urge parent to learn sign language so they can talk to their children. It’s so much easier to
                communicate with the same language.</p>

        <h4>The development of sign language in Tanzania </h4>
        <p>The development of sign language in Tanzania is a quite different story from the development of sign
            language in Uganda. In Tanzania sign language is not the main way of communicate. How come?</p>

<p>Listen to the interview with Thomas Elias Shayo:</p>
<enable-audio sound-filename="thomas.mp3"></enable-audio>
                <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview">
                    <p>It is historical. In Tanzania, education for the deaf has been provided by NGOs and churches
                        from way back in 1960s. So the first school for the deaf which was supported from by
                        roman-catholic church in Tabora region, was teaching the learners  in speech, we call it
                        oralism. So the deaf  learners were told to speak, were forced to be able to speak to
                        become normal. And the philosophy behind it was that; signing was not good for deaf people,
                        because if they sign other people will not understand them. Their families will
                        not understand them, so the church decided that the best way to teach them is to speak, but
                        unfortunately they could not teach them to hear. And that was a big problem.</p>
                    <p> We face challenges because deafness in East-African countries is not inherited. Deafness
                           comes by disease. Most of the deaf cases in Tanzania are by diseases, like meningitis,
                           malaria and other things. Now if there is only one deaf person in a family of lets say
                           ten-twenty people, this deaf person becomes isolated. Now, sign language is the best way, but
                           who will teach sign language to all this family members so they can communicate with this one
                           person. It looks like a very big  job and very expensive. So when this deaf child goes to
                           school so it natural that when they meet and they understand that we are all deaf, they start
                           signing. But their signing is not standardized, it depends on the school. We use to
                           have ten schools for the deaf in the whole country with a population of almost
                           fifty millions.<br> But now it is changing because the government is opening up
                           units in all primary schools, many primary schools. At least we are having some
                           deaf communities in these schools and they develop their own signing because there is no
                           one to teach them sign language, there is no one to copy from. So we have a diverse
                           vocabulary of signing from all over the country. Sign language is a problem, it is the
                           best way for the deaf, but it a problem; where do you go to learn sign language?</p>
                    <p>The thing is, there are no qualified interpreters in Tanzania because there is no place, no
                        college in this country where you can go and get a bachelor's degree in sign language or even a
                        diploma or even a certificate. </p>

                <p>Around twenty preschool children and five teachers crouch in a circle outdoor in the
                schoolyard. They are playing a game. One boy runs outside the circle and suddenly he claps another child on her head.<br>
                One teacher says: That one. Go.<br>
                The boy sits down and the girl starts running. After half a round she taps another boy on his head. He starts running and
                the kid is laughing. He seems very happy. The next activity is a teacher who stand in the middle of the circle doing something
                which look like a morning exercise. She jumps up and down clapping her hands over her head. The children stand in the
                circle and imitate the teachers movement.<br> The teacher says: Ok, now I'm going to pick one to come and do it for us.
                You are going to do the same there.<br> A child replaces the teacher and the exercise continues.<br>
                The teacher says: When I'm introducing a new activity, obviously, first it's me to do it. Then they see what I've done and
                copy it. They follow what I do and do the same. But first I explain to them in sign language.<br>
                A new activity take place. The children stand in a line. <br>In front of them the teacher explains, both verbally
                and with sign language: Look at me, I am going to clap, and then you run. I clap you run. Have you heard? Ok.<br>
                Two boys are squatting in a start position ready to run.<br>The teacher says: Look at me.<br>
                The teacher claps her hands and the children run as fast as they can.<br>
                The teacher says: Since they don't know these signs well, we sometimes do gestures first.<br>
                A new pair of children start running. The other children and teachers cheer on the competitors.<br>
                The teacher says: After that they learn the real signs. After learning the real signs they do the activities themselves.<br>
                The children are sitting in the shade of a tree side by side in a row. In front of them teacher try to
                get the childrens attention.<br>
                The teacher says: Look here. Look at me. Eyes here.<br>
                She is showing a leaf when she says: This is a leaf.<br>
                Then she shows the children the sign for leaf.<br>
                She says: This one is a leaf.<br>
                The children imitate the sign the teacher make with their hands.<br>
                She says: Have you all seen? Good.<br>
                In an interview under a big tree the teacher says: We normally teach the basics in sign language. Like how to sign a cup, a
                ball or water. We teach the children the basics in different areas. In those areas there are some competances, some learning
                activities, learning development. That is what we teach.</p>
            </enable-read-more>
        <p>In summary, first the children imitate the teachers movement and copy them.<br>Then they learn new concepts and signs
            through pysical acticities.<br>New signs are presented in different representations;<br>- as physical objects,<br>- as
            drawings and<br>- as written words.</p>
