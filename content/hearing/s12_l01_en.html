        <ol><li><p><strong>Can children with hearing impairment benefit from education?</strong><br>
            Yes, children with hearing impairment can benefit from education like any other children. They will, however, need extra support and improved communication, for example in the use of sign language in order to learn better.</li>
            <li>I<strong>s it true that persons with hearing impairment are aggressive?</strong><br>
                No! All persons demonstrate aggression if they are provoked or not understood. Persons with hearing impairment are very friendly when you communicate in a language that they understand and respect their rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Apart from deaf people, who else can use sign language?</strong><br>
    Sign language is a language in its own right, and is recognized by most national constitutions. All people who interact with deaf people should therefore learn sign language in order to communicate with them better.</li>
            <li>Can children with hearing impairment learn together with the hearing peers?
                The policy providing for inclusive education requires that all children learn together without discrimination and with necessary support. Children with hearing impairment can therefore learn together with their peers in ordinary or inclusive schools. They can even learn better with modification in aspects such as communication, classroom environment, and the curriculum. We should always demonstrate positive attitudes towards children with hearing impairment</li>
            <li> Can deaf people marry and have families with hearing people?
                Yes. Many deaf people are married to spouses who are either deaf or hearing. What is important is that they should love each other, be able to communicate and support each other.</li>

           <li>What employment opportunities are available for deaf people?
               Persons who are deaf can be employed in all sectors. They are able to concentrate and be productive in the assignments given to them.</li>
           <li> Do all deaf people use sign language?
               No! Some deaf people who acquire deafness at a later age may not know sign language. They are able to read speech (lip-read) and print, as well as use gestures for communication. Some deaf people are not able to use sign language because they have not had the opportunity to learn it. These use gestures and other non-verbal means of communication.</p></li>
