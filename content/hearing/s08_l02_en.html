    <p>Cochlear implants may help provide hearing in patients who are deaf because of damage to sensory hair cells in their cochleas. In those patients, the implants often can enable sufficient hearing for better understanding of speech. </p>
    <p>The quality of sound is different from natural hearing, with less sound information being received and processed by the brain. However, many patients are able to hear and understand speech and environmental sounds. </p>
    <enable-grey-box e-type="warning"><h4>Cochlear implants do not eliminate deafness. An implant is not a cure and an implanted individual is still deaf. Cochlear implants may destroy what remaining hearing an individual may have. If the deaf or hard of hearing child or adult later prefers to use an external hearing aid, that choice may be removed.</h4></enable-grey-box>
