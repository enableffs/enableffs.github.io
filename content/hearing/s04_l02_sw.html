        <enable-read-more label="Audio description"><p>In a classroom, a group of hard of hearing and deaf students are sitting on the floor making rugs. The students, both girls and boys, are around 13-14 years
            old. Some of the students are working with sewing machines on a table. A female teacher facilitates the work and give them advices. A boy is making jewellery by
            threading pearls. Two boys are sitting on the floor making rugs.<br><br>
            Outside the building a female teacher using sign language explains whats going on:<br>
            We have a vocational training in this school because some children are not so good at classroom work. And they do not benefit more on academic aspects. So, when
            this happens we have these children taken to the vocational training. And it also helps them in their future life. That is why we have the
            vocational training in school.<br><br>
            In another classroom a group of students make cookies. Another teacher facilitates the work. A dough is kneaded and rolled out.<br><br>
            The deaf teacher continues explaining in sign language:<br>
            We choose a few for baking activity because on the same time we have academic classroom training so those who cannot compete academically
            come for the vocational training which is baking. Making cakes and cookies and so on.<br><br>
            Another dough is rolled out. An empty tin can be used to produce cookies. The cookies are moved to a baking tray
            which is put into an oven made of bricks.<br><br>
            The deaf teacher continues explaining in sign language:<br>
            For example, if a child has completed primary seven and has not passed well academically. They do not have many possibilities, and maybe it is
            hard to pass the exam. Then they can select an area for vocational skills. And get some employment. We also have vocational training at a higher
            level. Then they can use the training they have as basic, and join another school that only concentrates on vocational training.

            <p>A group of deaf students in secondary school are preparing sandwiches together
            with their teacher. They are in a classroom and the other students are sitting and watch the preparation. The teacher communicates with the
            students using sign language.<br>
            Alternating seeing a close shot of teacher and the students preparing the food, the teacher says: When mothers are doing their
            domestic chores, they talk to their children. But because they don't know how to communicate to their deaf children they kind of
            leave them. So, this child grows without skills. Basic skills in the home. Here in Africa Children participate. They participate
            in the home chores. So, you find out that the deaf child is pampered. The mother might feel sorry for the deaf child and won't
            let them participate. Even then, how will the mother tell them? So, these children lacks skills.<br>
            A girl cut a bread into two pieces while the teacher and the other students are preparing salad for the sandwiches.<br>
            The teacher says: But simple things like making a vegetable sandwich, which they can even sell as a business when they have
            grown. I think it is a good skill for them to know. There are many more skills that can be built.<br>
            The students who have been watching the preparation now can pick up the prepared sandwiches. Afterwards they sit down and eat
            the prepared food. They obviously like the food.<br>
            The teacher says: So, I introduce such things, then they will go home and ask their mother to by this and that because they saw it be made here. Then they can make something and
            the parents can appreciate them.</p>

          Matokeo yake ni kwamba watoto ambao ni viziwi wanakosa stadi za kazi za nyumbani. Wanafunzi katika video
           hii wanajifunza kutengeneza sandwichi. Wanaweza kupata kipato kwa kuuza sandwichi. </p>
