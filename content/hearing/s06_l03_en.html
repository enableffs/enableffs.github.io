<p>Nancy Katumba Muwangala volunteers to teach deaf children about their sexual health.</p>
      <h2>Information about sexual issues for deaf students</h2>
      <p>Most of the deaf children don’t get information about sexuality from their parents. Many parents are embarrassed to talk about this issue.
          And even if they want to talk about it, they might not know how to communicate with their deaf child. This makes it really difficult
          for the deaf children to learn how to behave when it comes to sexual issues. </p>

<p>Without knowledge about their own sexuality and limits they are vulnerable to sexual abuse including rape. Deaf children who are raped also have a hard time explaining
    to their parents and even to the police or other law enforcement officers about what they have been exposed to. And even if they are able to explain it, the police
    often do not take these issues serious. This is a big problem, but getting a proper education could make them deaf better prepared and able to explain if
    something happens to them.</p>
        <p>Parents should provide sexuality education to their children or engage someone to do it on their behalf.</p>
