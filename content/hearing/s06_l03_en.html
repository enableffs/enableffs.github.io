            <i>[A female teacher holds a poster with illustrations of the male and female genitals towards
            lower secondary  learners who are hearing impaired. The  learners giggle and laugh. The teacher shows a new poster which illustrate
            the physical changes in girls. She walks around in the classroom so the  learners can take a closer look at the poster.
            The  learners, both girls and boys, laugh.<br><br>[In a  picture the teacher says:] "You saw their excitement when I
            was showing them these pictures. They don´t know these things. They think they are private. But they still should be free with
            their private life. So, you can see that parents may not have the ability to communicate such issues. Because parents even find
            it difficult to communicate with their hearing children. Such issues are sensitive".<br><br>
            The teacher communicates to the  learners using sign language. She is pointing at a girl who goes towards the blackboard.</i><br>
            <br><br>
            <i>[The teacher continues:]</i><br>
            "So, she's the only one whose parents has talked to her about sexual health.
            The girl tells her experience to the other  learners using sign language. The teacher interprets the signs to oral speech:
            Her mother has told her all that when she was a child. She's now understanding everything about maturity. And she knows how to
            behave. Her mother told her this because she wanted to protect her from sexual harassment. She could get raped if she's not careful."
            <br><br>
            <i>[When the girl has told her experience the teacher and the  learners applaud in a silent way waving their hands.<br><br>
            In a picture the teacher says:]</i><br> "If the mother or father don't talk to their children, who will? So, if a parent is shy
            talking about sexual issues with a child whom they can communicate with, what about the deaf child? It becomes so difficult. So,
            they leave them, they tell their siblings to tell them. And you can never know. They could get wrong information."<br><br>
            <i>[The teacher has a conversation in sign language with a girl. Off-screen she says:]</i>
            "So that’s why I've done this voluntary counseling whenever they approach me.
            They get problems as growing girls. A few boys as well. But there are many girls."

      <h2>Information about sexual issues for deaf  learners</h2>
      <p>Most of the deaf children don’t get information about sexuality from their parents. Many parents are embarrassed to talk about this issue.
          And even if they want to talk about it, they might not know how to communicate with their deaf child. This makes it really difficult
          for the deaf children to learn how to behave when it comes to sexual issues. </p>

<p>Without knowledge about their own sexuality and limits, they are vulnerable to sexual abuse including rape. Deaf children who are raped also have a hard time explaining
    to their parents and even to the police or other law enforcement officers about what they have been exposed to. And even if they are able to explain it, the police
    often do not take these issues serious. This is a big problem, but getting a proper education could make the deaf leaners better prepared and able to explain if
    something happens to them.</p>
        <p>Parents should provide sexuality education to their children or engage someone to do it on their behalf.</p>
