        <enable-grey-box><h4>When an object is hit or when we use our voice, the air around us starts moving, thus creating sound waves.</h4></enable-grey-box>

        <p>The external ear (also known as the pinna) intercepts the sound waves and directs them into the ear. The sound waves then travel into the ear through
            the ear canal and hit the ear drum (tympanic membrane) causing it to vibrate. The three tiny bones (malleus, incus and stapes) in the
            middle ear receive the sound waves and then transmit them into the inner ear through the oval window.</p>
        <p>In the inner ear, the cochlea turns the sound waves into tiny signals which are transmitted to the brain through the auditory nerve. The brain then
            interprets the sound signals giving them meaning. </p>

        <p>In order for us to hear well, the ear and the brain work very hard, and together. If they donâ€™t, this can lead to hearing loss which may
            be partial or even deafness.</p>

            <p><strong>Pinna (Auricle)</strong> is the visible part of the ear that resides outside the head. The
                auricle functions to collect sound and transform it to directional and other information. The auricle
                collects sound acts as a funnel amplifies it and directs it to the auditory canal. (Source:

            </p>
            <p><strong>Auditory canal</strong>or the ear canal (external auditory meatus, external acoustic meatus, EAM),
                is a tube running from the outer ear to the middle ear. The adult human ear canal extends from the pinna
                to the eardrum and is about 2.5 centimetres (1 in) in length and 0.7 centimetres (0.3 in) in diameter.

            <p><strong>Ear drum (Tympanic membrane)</strong> is a thin, cone-shaped membrane that separates the external
                ear from the middle ear in humans and other tetrapods. Its function is to transmit sound from the air to
                the ossicles inside the middle ear, and then to the oval window in the fluid-filled cochlea. Hence, it
                ultimately converts and amplifies vibration in air to vibration in fluid. The malleus bone bridges the
                gap between the eardrum and the other ossicles. (Source:

            </p>
            <p><strong>Malleus</strong> or hammer is a hammer-shaped small bone or ossicle of the middle ear which
                connects with the incus and is attached to the inner surface of the eardrum. It transmits the sound
                vibrations from the eardrum to the incus. (Source:

            </p>
            <p><strong>The incus</strong> is a bone in the middle ear. The anvil-shaped small bone is one of three
                ossicles in the middle ear. The incus receives vibrations from the malleus, to which it is connected
                laterally, and transmits these to the stapes, medially.(Source:

            </p>
            <p><strong>The stapes</strong> is a bone in the middle ear of humans and other mammals which is involved in
                the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear. The stirrup-shaped small bone is the one that transmits
                these to the oval window, medially. The stapes is the smallest and lightest named bone in the human
                body. (Source:

            </p>
            <p><strong>The elliptical window</strong> (oval window or vestibular window) is a membrane-covered opening
                which leads from the middle ear to the vestibule of the inner ear. Vibrations that come into contact
                with the tympanic membrane travel through the three ossicles and into the inner ear. The oval window is
                the intersection of the middle ear with the inner ear, and is directly contacted by the stapes; by the
                time vibrations reach the oval window, they have been amplified over twenty times from what they were
                when they contacted the tympanic membrane, a testament to the amplifying power of the middle ear.

            <p><strong>The circular window</strong> (round window) is one of the two openings from the middle ear into
                the inner ear. It is sealed by the round window membrane, which vibrates with opposite phase to
                vibrations entering the inner ear through the oval window. It allows fluid in the cochlea to move, which
                in turn ensures that hair cells of the basilar membrane will be stimulated and that audition will occur.

            <p><strong>The vestibular nerve</strong> is one of the two branches of the Vestibulocochlear nerve (the
                cochlear nerve being the other). In humans the vestibular nerve transmits sensory information
                transmitted by vestibular hair cells located in the two otolith organs (the utricle and the saccule) and
                the three semicircular canals via the vestibular ganglion. Information from the otolith organs reflects
                gravity and linear accelerations of the head. Information from the semicircular canals reflects
                rotational movement of the head. Both are necessary for the sensation of body position and gaze
                stability in relation to a moving environment. (Source:

            <p><strong>The auditory nerve</strong> (also called cochlear nerve or acoustic nerve) is one of two parts of the
                vestibulocochlear nerve, a cranial nerve present in amniotes. The cochlear nerve carries auditory
                sensory information from the cochlea of the inner ear directly to the brain. The other portion of the
                vestibulocochlear nerve is the vestibular nerve, which carries spatial orientation information to the
                brain from the semicircular canals. (Source:

            <p><strong>The cochlea</strong> is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a spiral-shaped cavity in
                the bony labyrinth, in humans making 2.5 turns around its axis, the modiolus. A core component of the
                cochlea is the

            <p><strong>The tympanic cavity</strong> is a small cavity surrounding the bones of the middle ear. On its
                lateral surface, it abuts the external auditory meatus from which it is separated by the tympanic
                membrane (eardrum). (Source:

            <p><strong>The auditory tube</strong>, also known as the Eustachian tube or pharyngotympanic tube, is a tube
                that links the nasopharynx to the middle ear. It is a part of the middle ear. In adult humans the
                auditory tube is approximately 35 mm (1.4 in) long. (Source:

        <h3>Sound</h3>

        <br>
        <p>Sound is described as waves or oscillation. Long waves give the sound a bass character, while the short ones give the sound treble characteristics.<br><br>
            The pitch of the waves is measured in Hertz (Hz), which is the number of cycles of waves per second.</p>
        <ul><li>A pitch which has many cycles per second will be experienced as high pitch because it has a high frequency of waves.</li>
        <li>A pitch which has fewer cycles per second will be experienced as low pitch because it has a low frequency of waves.</li></ul>
        <p>The intensity of sound or the volume is measured in decibels (dB). Normal voice from the distance of
            1 metre is around 60 dB and high music is around 100-110 dB.
            If the sound is around 110-130 dB most people will find it strong and hurting to the ear.<br><br>
            Usually sound moves around the air at the speed of 330 metres per second, but
            under water it moves much faster, at the speed of around 1400 metres per second.</p>
