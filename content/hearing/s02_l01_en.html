    <div layout-padding layout="column" class="partialContent">
        <p>Hearing impairment, also commonly referred to as hearing loss, is the inability of the ear to process sound either totally or partially.
            Hearing loss may be grouped into the following two categories:</p>
        <p><strong>Hard of hearing</strong> refers to hearing loss which is mild or moderate which does not completely hinder a person’s ability to hear certain
            sounds or spoken language. Persons who are hard of hearing may be able to communicate using spoken language and can benefit
            from amplification devices such as a hearing aid.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Deafness</strong> refers to severe or profound hearing loss. Persons who are deaf hear very little or no sounds at all. This implies that they have to
            use manual methods of communication such as gestures and sign language.</p>

        <p>Sound is described as waves or oscillation. Long waves gives the sound a bass character and short waves gives
            the sound treble characteristiscs.</p>



        <h3>Classification of hearing impairment </h3>

        <p>Hearing impairment can vary from no impairment to deafness. The World Health Organisation (WHO) describes grades of
            hearing impairment as follow:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>

                <th>Level of hearing impairment</th>
                <th>Corresponding audiometric</th>
                <th>Performance</th>
                <th>Recommendations</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0 - No impairment</td>
                <td>25 dB or better (better ear)</td>
                <td>No or very slight hearing problems. Able to hear whispers.</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1 - Slight impairment</td>
                <td>26-40 dB (better ear)</td>
                <td>Able to hear and repeat words spoken in normal voice at 1 metre.</td>
                <td>Counselling. Hearing aids may be needed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2 - Moderate impairment</td>
                <td>41-60 dB (better ear)</td>
                <td>Able to hear and repeat words spoken in raised voice at 1 metre.</td>
                <td>Hearing aids usually recommended.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3 - Severe impairment</td>
                <td>61-80 dB (better ear)</td>
                <td>Able to hear some words when shouted into better ear.</td>
                <td>Hearing aids needed. If no hearing aids available, lip-reading and signing should be taught.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4 - Profound impairment including deafness</td>
                <td>81 dB or greater (better ear)</td>
                <td>Unable to hear and understand even a shouted voice.</td>
                <td>Hearing aids may help understanding words. Additional rehabilitation needed. Lip-reading and manual methods of communication is essential.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Grades 2, 3 and 4 are classified as <strong>disabling hearing impairment.</strong></p>

        </p>
        <enable-grey-box><h4>Disabling hearing loss refers to:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>- hearing loss greater than 40 decibels (dB) in the better hearing ear in adults</li>
                <li>- hearing loss greater than 30 dB in the better hearing ear in children</li>
            </ul>
        </enable-grey-box>

        <h3>Causes of hearing loss</h3>
        <p>The main cause of hearing loss in low and middle income countries is infections/diseases. As a result of this, there may be
            many people with hearing loss in these countries.</p>

        <p>The causes of hearing loss and deafness can be divided into <strong>congenital causes</strong> and <strong>acquired</strong>
            causes.</p>
        <h4>Congenital causes</h4>

        <p>Congenital causes may lead to hearing loss being present at or acquired soon after birth. Hearing loss can be
            caused by hereditary and non-hereditary genetic factors or by certain complications during pregnancy and at
            childbirth, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>maternal rubella, syphilis or certain other infections during pregnancy;</li>
            <li>low birth weight;</li>
            <li>birth asphyxia (a lack of oxygen at the time of birth);</li>
            <li>inappropriate use of particular drugs such as aminoglycosides, cytotoxic drugs,
                antimalarial drugs and diuretics during pregnancy;
            </li>
            <li>severe jaundice in the neonatal period, which can damage the hearing nerve in a newborn infant.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Acquired causes</h4>

        <p>Acquired causes may lead to hearing loss at any age, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>infectious diseases such as meningitis, measles and mumps
            </li>
            <li>chronic ear infections<br>
                <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Chronic ear infections are a leading cause of hearing loss
                </enable-quotebox>
            </li>

            <li>collection of fluid in the ear (otitis media);<br>
                <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Among children, chronic otitis media is the leading cause of hearing
                    loss
                </enable-quotebox>
            </li>
            <li>use of particular drugs, such as some antibiotic and antimalarial medicines</li>
            <li>injury to the head or ear</li>
            <li>excessive noise, including occupational noise such as that from machinery and explosions, and
                recreational noise such as that from personal audio devices, concerts, nightclubs, bars and sporting
                events
            </li>
            <li>ageing, in particular due to degeneration of sensory cells;</li>
            <li>wax or foreign bodies blocking the ear canal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>An example</h4>
        <enable-grey-box ><p>About 60% of the children at the Uganda School for the Deaf were born hearing. Many contracted childhood diseases
            like Mumps, Measles, Whooping Cough, High Fever, Meningitis and Malaria that resulted in their Deafness. For some,
            their mothers contracted rubella during pregnancy. Others lost hearing due to chronic otitis media left untreated
            for many years, while others get the problem through drug side effects. Other causes are not yet know.</p></enable-grey-box>
