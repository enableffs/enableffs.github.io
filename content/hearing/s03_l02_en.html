        <h3>Communication is a big challenge</h3>
        <p>The biggest challenge for people with hearing loss is <strong>communication</strong>. Although parts of the sound falls out,
            it is still possible to perceive somebody is talking. But when some sounds are missing or weak, it may be difficult to
            understand the exact meaning of what is being said.</p><p> Other people may have difficulty understanding this, for
        example it may have consequences for the child's language development.</p>

        <h4>Children with hearing loss</h4>
        <p>Hearing loss in children does not only make it difficult for them to communicate with other people; it also slows down,
            or even prevents altogether, their learning. A great deal of what children learn comes from what they (over) hear. They
            hear their family members talking and they learn. They hear people in the community talking and they learn. They hear
            other children talking and they learn. They hear the radio or television and they learn. All this is in addition to what
            is said to them.<br> Children who have a hearing loss miss out on all this learning.<br> Even children who are only a little bit hearing impaired miss
            out; children who are very hearing impaired miss out nearly everything. So they need very special help in order to learn.</p>

        <h4>Unilateral Hearing Loss (UHL) and the development of a child</h4>
        <p>Having unilateral hearing loss will mean to have a hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing in the other.</p>

        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Hi! Kick the ball to me!</enable-quotebox>

        <p>For people with unilateral hearing loss it is not easy to locate the sound. From which direction did the sound came?</p>

        <p>Sound localization is <u>one</u> of the challenges related to unilateral hearing loss.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Localization is important when listening in groups of people. It helps direct us to who is talking at any moment. If a child takes longer to identify who is talking, he or she may miss some of the message.</li>
        <li>Localization is also important for safety. If a child is near the street, he or she may have trouble localizing a horn.</li>
    </ul>
        <p>Other challenges can be:</p>
        <ul><li>Evaluation of the distance to the audio input.</li>
            <li>Speech intelligibility from the side with hearing loss</li>
            <li>Speech perception and communication in noisy environments. Two normal hearing ears help us to filter out noise to better hear speech.</li>
        </ul>

        <enable-read-more label="Read more about unilateral hearing loss">
            <p>When there is a big difference between hearing the left and right ears , the processing of audio signals from the side with hearing loss can often be reduced . One may find that the audio signals coming into the side with hearing loss , are not used . This is a dynamic that person does not govern themselves.</p>
            <h3>Unilateral hearing loss (UHL) and the development of the child</h3>
            <p>A child is in the process of developing language and cannot make a guess or "fill in the gaps" about what he or she didn't understand.</p>
            <p>However, a child's unilateral hearing loss will not keep him or her from learning to talk even if some children with UHL have been found to have delays in their speech and language devepment. There are many ways you can help your child:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Being aware of typical language development</li>
                <li>Being a good speech and language model for your child</li>
                <li>Being aware of your child's listening environment will help.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How to help children with UHL</h4>
            <p>Adults can help children with UHL by being good speech and language models the children and being aware of the listening environment. Some advises to help children with UHL:</p>

            <ul><li>Be aware of where your child's "normal" hearing ear is facing.</li>
                <li>Let the child face the person speaking or if his or her normal hearing ear is facing the person.</li>
                <l>Make eye contact when speaking to your child.</l>
                <li>Talk about your daily routine.</li>
                <li>Use repetition and expand your child's vocabulary by introducing new words.</li>
                <li>Get your child's attention before talking to him or her. Be sure the child don´t miss any of the intended message.</li>
                <li>Help your child localize sound if he or she appears to be having difficulty.</li>
                <li>Look for cues that your child understands what you are saying.</li>
                <li>Raise your voice slightly and face him or her when you are at a greater distance.</li>
                <li>Don´t give directions from another room.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Early Intervention</h4>
        <p>Early intervention is a comprehensive set of services that provided to children with hearing loss and their families in order to
            minimize the effect of this disability and to enhance their development. Early intervention services are crucial to minimizing
            the impact of hearing loss on a child’s development and educational achievements. Early intervention programmes can improve the
            linguistic and educational outcomes for the child.</p>
        <p>Early intervention also helps families of children with hearing loss to make decisions about their child such as:</p>
        <ul><li>The communication approach to be used</li>
            <li>Educational placement for the child</li>
            <li>The hearing technology to be used for the child</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In infants and young children with hearing loss, children with deafness should be given the opportunity to learn sign language along with their families. </p>
        <h4>Conditions for developing communication skills</h4>
        <p>Deaf and hearing-impaired children often have a poor conceptual framework and difficulty to reflect on their own and others'
            feelings and experiences. The result can be can social difficulties and difficulties in making friends. Because of lack of
            basic concepts many children are struggling academically at school. For getting a good language development sign language
            environment is absolutely essential for these children. It is a precondition for social adjustment and for good mental health
            later in life to create an inner voice for thinking and understanding. It is essential that parents and children get the
            opportunity to communicate well right from the start. That's when the connection between parents and children formed and the
            interplay between them should start.<br>For hard of hearing children early communication with sign language in addition to
            speech is an advantage for the development of spoken language and concepts and have good impact on later reading and writing
            skills.</p>


        <p>Early detection and intervention are crucial to minimizing the impact of hearing loss on a child’s
            development and educational achievements. In infants and young children with hearing loss, early identification and management through infant hearing
            screening programmes can improve the linguistic and educational outcomes for the child.</p>
