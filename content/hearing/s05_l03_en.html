        <p>A sign language interpreter is a person trained in interpreting between a spoken and sign language. This means that
            this person renders what is said in spoken language into sign language for someone who cannot hear but understands
            sign language. This interpreter also relays sign language into spoken language to be understood by a hearing person.</p>
        <h4>Signing and voicing</h4>

        <enable-read-more label="Audio description"><p>A female teacher at Kyambogo University stands among a group of students who learn about
            interpreting sign language and voicing. She gives her instructions to the students before an exercise in voicing:<br>
            We are looking at the voices. At least you have to make sure you are loud enough. For somebody who is by the chalkboard to
            hear you very well. Make sure you are loud enough. Okey?<br><br>
            On a TV- monitor a woman is telling a story using sign language. To students, a boy and a girl, are sitting in front of the monitor
            looking at the woman on the screen. The other students are sitting backwards to the monitor.<br><br>
            The male student is voicing:
            Good afternoon. My sign name is that one (sign). My name is Devola Aiteh. I work in Uganda with Uganda National Association of
            the Deaf (UNAD).<br><br>
            The student continues interpreting while the woman continuing signing on the screen:<br>
            I'm a board member and a secretary general for the World Federation of the Deaf.<br><br>
            Off screen the voice of the teacher is heard when the voicing continues:<br>
            This is a class for sign language interpreters and we have interpreters who are doing both signing and voicing in the
            community for deaf persons and for hearing persons. What I was doing now was about voicing. By looking at the signer you are
            able to explain or interpret what they say by using your voice.<br><br>
            In a close up the teacher continues saying:<br>
            In doing so you have to be mindful of the language that you are using. The quality of the voice and the culture of the spoken
            language.<br><br>
            On the TV- screen the woman continues signing.<br><br>
            The teacher is standing among the students and asks the two students:<br>
            How was it?<br><br>
            The male student answers:<br>
            For the voice, I tried my best.<br><br>
            The teacher talks to the other students:<br>
            The voice, ha? What do you think? What would you say? How was his voice? On a scale from one to ten?<br><br>
            A student answers:<br>
            Nine.<br><br>
           Beside the teacher a male teacher is interpreting what is said in sign language to the deaf students. The female teacher continues:<br>
            Nine. Wow. That is very good. Yes. Now, do you have any comments on the challenges that you realized you had?<br><br>
            A female student asks:<br>
            Is it ok when you interpret that you say my sign name is that one, for the people around?<br><br>
            The teacher repeats what the student said:<br>
            My sign name is THAT one. Especially that now you are facing the…Yes?<br><br>
            Another female student says:<br>
            The grammar there was actually wrong. When you are talking for someone using the first person, you put yourself in their shoes.
            He shouldn’t have said that, but this.<br><br>
            In a close up the teacher continues saying:<br>
            Each one is given an opportunity to voice out. And I usually want the other colleagues in the classroom to also participate
            by mentoring them, advising them on how they can produce the best quality sound.</p></enable-read-more>

        <h5>Criteria for being a good interpreter</h5>

        <p>"What your limitations are and what your strengths are. When you are sure of the voice you have, then the
            knowledge of the signs will be another advantage. So we normally want the interpreters to know themselves:
            what are they as a strength.</p>

        <p>Then you should be able to be fruitful to yourself, that I am doing what this person cannot do. Because if
            you misinterpret a client, sometimes it is not a good practice at all. So you should be fruitful and be able
            to tell the client that - I did not understood you, can you repeat what you are saying-.</p>

        <p>A good interpreter be able to listen attentively, should be able to voice out, should be able to cooperate
            with the co-interpreters and also cooperate with the clients."</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Important issues when interpreting to sign language</h5>

        <p>"In this class what is important is that the interpreter has the confidence to voice out loudly, loud enough
            for
            the audience to hear. And that the interpreter is able to put himself or herself into the shoes of the
            signer, because
            they act like the voices as those who do not have the voice.</p>

        <p>But they also be mindful of the culture, because sign
            language and spoken language are very different. So they should be able to put in, spice the signs with the
            culture of
            the spoken language.</p>

        <p>They using paralinguistic features, they should be mindful of the intonation, they should be
            mindful over the quality of the voice. The quality will also include the intonation, the pauses and of cause
            they
            have to be knowledgeable of what signs… what particular words is suitable for particular signs."</p>
        <h5>Confusion produced when speech and sign language are combined</h5>

        <p>"When we are teaching interpreters we bring(?) different deaf persons, those who are deafen at later age and
            those who are born deaf. You find that most interpreters find it easy to interpret for the deaf persons who
            have speech because they combine their signs with the speech. But they find it hard when somebody has
            completely no speech. But it is sometimes very confusing if somebody is speeching and signing, because then
            your voice, his or her voice they run together. So it really depends. But in this program we encourage even
            those who have no sign language background to join the course and we see that both of them are competing
            very well. So we have the chance to take the students to the deaf community where they experience both
            groups of deaf persons."</p></enable-read-more>
