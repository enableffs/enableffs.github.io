        <p>Hearing impairment may affect an individual in many ways. The most important are:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>functional communication</strong></li>
        <li><strong>social and emotional development</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>academic performance</strong></li>
            <li><strong>economic status</strong></li>

            <div style="width: 70%; display: inline-block;"><p>One of the main effects of hearing loss is on the individual’s ability to
                communicate with others. Language development is often delayed in children with hearing impairment.
                <br>However, when opportunities are provided for people with hearing
                loss to communicate, they can participate on an equal basis with others. The communication may be
                through spoken language combined with lip reading or through sign language.</p></div>

          ...when he arrives home, he comes with homework and shows it and we also help him. Therefore, I say he is doing well because we

            with hearing and speaking. So, it was very difficult for me and sometimes I thought the child was stubborn. But later on, I came to
            realize that he couldnot speak or hear. So, it become very difficult for me to communicate with him. So, So it wa until I took
            him to school that we started communicating little by little. And so, I get some training from the teachers here on
            sign language. So, it is easy now to know what the child wants so I too can help him. The only problems are with teaching equipment
            and hearing aids.

        <enable-audio sound-filename="mother2.mp3"></enable-audio>
        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><h5>Mother 2:</h5><p>I have two children with hearing impairment.
          The girl is called Mwajuma Kikamila and the boy Maenga Kikamila. The girl is in standard three and the boy in standard one.
          They were born with hearing ability but the first one lost hearing ability when she was nine years old. The boy lost it when he was six.
          The girl had already started her primary education at Rangitatu – a school for the hearing. When she lost her hearing ability, she was
          stopped from studying.
          From there I struggled to get a school for her. Hear age already advanced. Her colleagues had already reached standard eleven when I got this school.
          The children started schooling. <br><br>


           I am thankful! At this school the teachers love the children. Immediately after they were admitted the came home
          saying! Mother that school is good. We dint know that we are many who have hearing difficulties. we were suffering in the streets.
          Am happy that they now understand well. After coming to school, I was summoned by teacher Flora as well other teachers.
          When I arrived, it was deemed necessary that my elder child and I learn sign language.

          At home we all learn sign language. We now understand one another well with the children and the family environment is good. It's
          probably in the streets where we still have a few challenges here and there because the child is seen as having a hearing difficulty amongst
          hearing community.
          Sometimes the hearing children gang together and start beating, chasing them just because of his hearing problem.<br><br>

          ""...No! the girl does not usually get out of the home and there is a girl from a neighbouring house who comes here. When she comes, she takes out the sign
          language book and teaches her. As for the boy, most of his friends are out there in the streets. When he arrives from school and after eating,
          sometimes he sneaks and goes to play. As such its where he goes to play where he comes across challenges and that’s when he comes back wounded.
          Sometimes am called when he is fighting. But generally, people in the community do not know sign language.

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><h5>Mother 3:</h5><p>It is only the girl who can hear. This are twins they are my brother’s

            of them.<br><br>When she was still young she used to cry so much that she much that her father could not understand what was happening. And in the
            neighborhood, there was a girl who was started in this school.  And this neighbor told the father of this child that the girl had
            hearing problems. At that moment, when we realized that there was no problem.<br><br>So, we found this school and we brought the child here. Since
            then we have been settled. The crying is no more and we can understand the child if there is any problem, so things are no much better.<br><br>
            One thing is that; they get infuriated very easily. They have a lot of anger. So, usually they become too angry to the extent of even beating me,
            they beat me up and I did not understand why they do that, but it because of their makeup they become angry.<br><br>So, we are very thankful
            that the girl in the neighborhood who was deaf. Who has already completed her study has been so much assistant to this girl and she sometimes
            even instruct her. She is much more relaxed now.<br><br>She does not understand very much, she is a bit small in learning, but when she faces
            problems she usually goes to this girl in the neighborhood and get assistance so she can cope.</p></enable-read-more>

        <h4>CODA - Children of Deaf Parents</h4>

        <p>Approximately 90% of the children born to deaf parents are hearing. Since sign language is the preferred way of
            communication in families where the parents are deaf and the children are hearing, the network around them may be
            concerned about that the children get too little spoken language stimulation. In today's society, it is usually an
            unfounded concern.<br>The fact that the child learns both sign and oral language should be viewed
            as a benefit. Multilingualism is positive for cognitive development, including in terms of developing concepts
            and creativity.</p>

                Language Acquisition.</enable-link></p>
<p>Children who develop multiple languages simultaneously will at times mix languages. However, at any given time, it is the dominant
    language in the conversation that will dictate the pattern of language mixing. Additionally, it’s quite natural that the child will
    learn a linguistic term for an item in one language before the other. If the child alternates between the languages is called
    code-switching and there is no cause for concern. On the contrary, it testifies to a high degree of mastery of the language
    when they are able to utilize their entire language skills.</p>
        <h3>Social conventions</h3>
        <div layout="row" layout-margin>
            <div style="width: 50%; display: inline-block;"><enable-image picname="family.jpg" picalt="The whole family sitting outside the house"></div>

            <div style="width: 42%; display: inline-block;"><p>Hearing children of deaf parents grow up in homes with visual communication. They are accustomed to other forms
                of contact more than hearing children. Children who are accustomed to visual communication from an early age,
                often need eye contact when they talk with others. Lack of eye contact may cause a child to ignore or not to
                perceive messages. At home children are used to having contact by touching each other lightly on the
                arm, stamping the floor, blinking the lights, or tapping the table.</p></div>
        </div>
        <p> This may be unusual, but it is not -
            it's just a little difference. Parents cannot always explain what sounds mean, here the school can contribute
            both correction and explanation.<br>Parents, school staff and other residents in the child's network can reflect
            on and discuss different social conventions together with the child. This will be an important contribution,
            so the child can practise listening without seeing, and be conscious of the social conventions and sounds that are
            culturally accepted in the two cultures in which they live.</p>
        <h3>Effect on academic performance</h3>
        <p>Hearing loss can have significantly adverse effects on the academic performance of children. This is because the child
            may not hear some of the oral information presented by the teacher, and may consequently lag behind. The child has to
            rely on written instruction, in the absence of an interpreter. She/he may lack the opportunity for incidental learning
            that their hearing peers enjoy.</p>
        <p>Deaf parents may well help their children with homework, but like parents in general, there may be some parents
            who experience certain subjects as difficult. Many deaf people have the local oral and written language as their
            second language and may have a strained relationship with it. If the parents have little or no residual hearing,
            it can be hard to hear children in homework. Here, older siblings or others in the family networks can help, or an
            agreements may be reached with another person to support the child with homework.</p>

        <h3>Effects on social and emotional development </h3>

        <p>Limited access to services and exclusion from participation in day to day activities and communication can have significant
            impact on everyday life, causing feelings of loneliness, isolation and frustration, particularly among older people with hearing
            loss.

            If a person with congenital hearing loss has not been given the opportunity to learn sign language or other forms of communication
            as a child, he or she may feel excluded from social interaction.</p>

        <h3>Effects on economic status</h3>

        <p>In developing countries, children with hearing impairment, including deafness, rarely receive any formal education. Adults with
            hearing loss also have a much higher unemployment rate. Among those who are employed, a higher percentage of
            people with hearing loss are in the lower grades of employment compared with the general workforce.
            Improving access to education and vocational rehabilitation services, and raising awareness especially among
            employers about the needs of people with hearing loss, would decrease unemployment rates among this
            group and hence improve their economic status.</p>

        <p>In addition to the economic effects of hearing loss at an individual level, hearing loss substantially affects
            social and economic development in families, communities and countries.</p>
