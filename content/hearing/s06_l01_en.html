                communicate with others. Spoken language development is often delayed in children with deafness.
                Hearing loss and ear diseases such as otitis media can have a significantly adverse effect on the
                academic performance of children.<br>However, when opportunities are provided for people with hearing
                loss to communicate, they can participate on an equal basis with others. The communication may be
                through spoken language combined with lip reading or through sign language.</p></div>

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><h5>Father:</h5><p>When he was born, I was not aware whether he had problems
            with hearing and speaking. So, it was very difficult for me and sometimes I think the child was stubborn. But later on, I came to
            realize that he could speak or not hear. So, it become very difficult for me to communicate with him. So, when he came to school
            then when we started communicating using sign, so we can communicate a bit. And so, I get some training from the teachers here on
            sign language. So, it is easy now to know what the kid wants so I too can help him. The only problems are with teaching equipment
            and hearing aids; this are problems we cannot have them here.

            is too much for him and we help him. At home, we all accepted the situation, we have the child and somehow we understand sign language.
            My son can somehow talk so he combines both signing and talking so he tries to speech very loudly to that extent he is able to
            explain what he wants us to do for him.</p></enable-read-more>
        <h5>Listen to another mothers voice:</h5>
        <enable-audio sound-filename="mother2.mp3"></enable-audio>
        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><h5>Mother 2:</h5><p>I have two children studying here, both with hearing impairment.
            It is a girl in standard three and a boy in standard one. They were born with hearing ability but the first one lost hearing ability when
            was nine and the other lost hearing ability when he was six. The first one was starting at a primary school called Radipatu (?) but when
            she lost her hearing ability then the school terminated her from study so we were travelling looking for a school how could lead to moving
            ahead and it became difficult for her.<br><br> When we got this school, we thank God we are very happy. The children say the teachers are
            very kind, they are very nice. (and they say they come to learn that) There are more children with similar problems so they are not alone.
            When our children came here, we were cold by teacher Flora Benedict Chillangi who said that we should start learning the sign language. I
            together with my elder child and the younger one all want to the learn the sign language, so we at home all communicate using sign language.
            There are no communication problems at home.<br><br>
            At home, there are no problem, but at the street they may get some problems because those children who can hear well sometimes beat then
            up and sometimes they chase them because they can’t hear so they think they are troublesome. So this is the challenges they fight.<br><br>
            The girl does not usually go out of the home, but when she comes back from school she takes her sign book and shows the neighbor girl a bit
            of the signs. (and the neighbor girl who comes and she shows this other girl a bit of the signs.)
            But the boy, when the boy comes back home he usually go far away where he plays with the other children. On the way he got some trouble and
            sometimes they beat him and he comes back wounded. So that is the situation.

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><h5>Mother 2:</h5><p>It is only the girl who can hear. This are twins they are my brother’s
            children. When they were born, my brother did not realize that one of his children could not hear so he brought them to me and I now take care
            of them.<br><br>When she was still young she used to cry so much that she much that her father could not understand what was happening. And in the
            neighborhood, there was a girl who was started in this school.  And this neighbor told the father the father of this child that the girl had
            hearing problems. At that moment, when we realized that there was no problem.<br><br>So, we found this school and we brought the child here. Since
            then we have been settled. The crying is no more and we can understand the child if there is any problem, so things are no much better.<br><br>
            One thing is that; they get infuriated very easily. They have a lot of anger. So, usually they become too angry to the extent of even beating me,
            they beat me up and I did not understand why they do that, but it because of their makeup they become angry.<br><br>So, we are very thankful
            that the girl in the neighborhood who was deaf. Who has already completed her study has been so much assistant to this girl and she sometimes
            even instruct her. She is much more relaxed now.<br><br>She does not understand very much, she is a bit small in learning, but when she faces
            problems she usually goes to this girl in the neighborhood and get assistance so she can cope.</p></enable-read-more>

        <h3>CODA - Children Of Deaf Parents</h3>

        <p>Approximately 90% of the children born to deaf parents are hearing. Since sign language is the preferred way of
            communication in families where the parents are deaf and the children are hearing, the network around them may be
            concerned about that the children get too little spoken language stimulation. In today's society, it is usually an
            unfounded concern.<br>The fact that the child learns both sign language and the oral language should be viewed
            as a benefit. Multilingualism is positive for cognitive development, including in terms of developing concepts
            and creativity.</p>

                Language Acquisition.</enable-link></p>
<p>Children who develop multiple languages simultaneously will at times mix languages. At any given time it can vary which of
    the languages that are dominant. But the fact that the child learns the linguistic term for a term in one language
    before the other is quite natural. If the child alternates between the languages is called code-switching and there is
    no cause for concern. On the contrary, it testifies to a high degree of mastery of the language when they are able to
    utilize their entire language skills.</p>
        <h4>Social conventions</h4>
        <div layout="row" layout-margin>
            <div style="width: 50%; display: inline-block;"><enable-image picname="family.jpg" picalt="The whole family sitting outside the house"></div>
            <div style="width: 3%; display: inline-block;"></div>
            <div style="width: 42%; display: inline-block;"><p>Hearing children of deaf parents grow up in homes with visual communication. They are accustomed to other forms
                of contact than hearing children. Children who are accustomed to visual communication from an early age,
                often need eye contact when they talk with others. Lack of eye contact may cause that the child ignore or do
                not perceive messages. At home children are used to having you contact by touching each other lightly on the
                arm, stomp the floor, blinking the lights or tapping the table.</p></div>
        </div>
        <p> This may be unusual, but it is not -
            it's just a little different. Parents can not always explain what sounds mean, here you can school contribute
            both correction and explanation.<br>Parents, school staff and other residents in the child's network can reflect
            on and discuss on the different social conventions together with the kid. This will be an important contribution
            so the kid can practice listening without seeing, and be conscious of the social conventions and sounds that are
            culturally accepted in the two cultures in which they live.</p>
        <h4>Homework</h4>
        <p>Deaf parents may well help their children with homework, but like parents in general there may be some parents
            who experience certain subjects as difficult. Many deaf people have the local oral and written language as their
            second language and may have a strained relationship with it. If the parents have little or no residual hearing,
            it can be hard to hear children in homework. Here, older siblings or others in the family networks help, or that
            agreements are reached an arrangement with homework.</p>

        <h3>Social and emotional impact</h3>

        <p>Limited access to services and exclusion from communication can have a significant impact on everyday life,
            causing feelings of loneliness, isolation and frustration, particularly among older people with hearing
            loss.

            If a person with congenital deafness has not been given the opportunity to learn sign language as a child,
            he or she may feel excluded from social interaction.</p>

        <h3>Economic impact</h3>

        <p>In developing countries, children with hearing loss and deafness rarely receive any schooling. Adults with
            hearing loss also have a much higher unemployment rate. Among those who are employed, a higher percentage of
            people with hearing loss are in the lower grades of employment compared with the general workforce.
            Improving access to education and vocational rehabilitation services, and raising awareness especially among
            employers about the needs of people with hearing loss, would decrease unemployment rates among this
            group.</p>

        <p>In addition to the economic impact of hearing loss at an individual level, hearing loss substantially affects
            social and economic development in communities and countries.</p>
