        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>Hearing impairment is considered to be hidden disability because it is not always obvious to know that a
            person has this disability. Persons who have a hearing impairment
            are, therefore, identified by observing their behavior and listening to the manner in which they express
            themselves and or interact with other people.</p>
        <enable-grey-box><h4>Some of the characteristics that may indicate that a person might have a hearing loss are the following:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Not responding to verbal instructions</li>
            <li>Not responding to sounds</li>
            <li>Not showing interest in verbal conversations</li>
            <li>Frequent complaints of ear ache</li>
            <li>Having a discharge in the ear</li>
            <li>Giving inappropriate responses to verbal instructions</li>
            <li>Inability to speak</li>
            <li>Often staring at the speaker’s face</li>
            <li>Missing out speech sounds in words</li>
        </ul></enable-grey-box>
        <p>Persons who experience the above difficulties should be advised to undergo further assessment to establish
            their hearing status.
            The assessment may be a screening test or pure tone audiometry.</p>
        <h3>Screening</h3>
        <p>The above characteristics are not sufficient to enable one conclude that there is a hearing impairment. It is
            important to carry out a screening assessment
            in order to find out whether a person has a hearing problem or not.<br>The most widely used screening
            procedures for hearing loss involve measuring a person’s
            reaction to sounds. The following are some of the procedures used:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Distraction test (suitable for children 6-18 months)</strong><br>
                In this test, a child is assessed for low and high frequency sounds. The child is seated on the parent/
                guardian’s laps facing forward. The assessor then makes
                low and high frequency sounds one after another from behind, at a distance of one meter and at an angle
                of 45 degrees from each ear.<br><br>
                The assessor should observe whether the child will react to the low frequency sounds and high frequency
                sounds. Failure to react to the sounds is an indication
                that the child may have a hearing loss.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cooperative test (suitable for children 18-30 months)</strong><br>
                This test requires the child to carry out actions with toys or other play materials following a verbal
                instruction from the assessor.<br><br>
                The child is presented with the toy to play with. From behind the child, the assessor will give
                instructions to the child such as ’give it to mammy’ or,
                put it in the box’ etc. The instructions should be made at a distance of one meter from the child, and
                at an angle of 45 degrees from each ear.<br><br>
                The assessor should observe whether the child will respond to the verbal instructions or reacts to
                his/her voice. Inability to carry out the instruction
                or react to it is an indication that the child may have a hearing loss.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Performance test (suitable for children 2 ½ years and above)</strong><br>
                In this test, the child is expected to perform an activity following a ‘go’ command from the assessor.
                The child sits facing forward and is presented
                with some play materials. He /she is instructed to perform the activity (such as put the toy in a box)
                on hearing the ‘go ‘command.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The assessor has to observe whether the child is able to carry out the activity each time the command is
            given. Failure to carry out the activity when
            the commands are given is an indication that the child may have a hearing loss.</p>


        <h3>Pure tone Audiometry Test</h3>
        <p>Even if the person passes the screening tests, hearing loss can develop later. An audiometric assessment may
            be recommended for all persons who are suspected to
            have a hearing loss. This test also helps to find out more detail about the nature of the hearing loss
            (whether it is mild, moderate or severe) and the level
            in which each ear may be affected.</p>

        <h4>The audiogram</h4>
        <p>Results from audiometric assessment are recorded and presented in a an audiogram. It is a graph which gives a
            detailed description of your hearing ability. It describes
            which sounds can be heard and which sounds are missing. The results of the measured hearing are
            characterized in a curve in the audiogram. The curve gives a visual
            representation of the hearing loss. An audiogram can give a picture of an individuals hearing, but it says
            nothing about how an individual utilizes auditory
            impressions. Two people with similar audiograms can have two very different experiences of hearing.<br><br>
        <h4>Examples of audiograms</h4>
            <p>The examples of audiograms and sounds without and with hearing loss of hearing below tries to
            simulate how different hearing loss <u>can</u> turn out.</p>

        </ul>
        <h4>The "speech banana"</h4>
        <p>The <strong>"speech banana"</strong> in the audigram shows the area where the speaking voice is at normal
            hearing. Within this area are all the sounds of the letters themselves.</p>
        <div layout="row" layout-margin>
            <div style="width: 60%; display: inline-block;"><enable-image picname="spbanana.jpg" picalt="Audiogram showing speech banana"></enable-image></div>

        </div>


        <h4>High frequency loss</h4>
        <p><strong>High frequency loss</strong> (ski-slope loss) is the most common type of hearing loss. The line in
            the audiogram starts high and then falls off as the frequency increases. The result is that people with high
            frequency loss will have trouble hearing the sounds that distinguish consonants, and that will make it sound
            like people are mumbling. In this example the consonants "f", "g", "k", "s", "t" and th" become difficult to
            hear. In noisy surroundings it becomes difficult to understand speech. It is easier to hear male than female
            voices. Some ambient sounds, such as birds singing, are gone.</p>

        </div>

        <h4>Cookiebite loss</h4>
        <p>A hearing loss that looks like a bite has been taken out of the middle of your audiogram is called <strong>a
            cookie bite loss</strong> and it is relatively rare. It means that you hear better in the low and high
            frequencies but less well in the middle frequencies. In this example many consonants, "ch", "g", "h", "k",
            "p", "r", "sh", and the vowel "a" are lost. Losses in this area affects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>speech intelligibility (mids and tweeters)</li>
            <li>the perception of environmental sounds</li>
            <li>make it difficult to understand speech in noisy surroundings.</li>
        </ul>
        <div layout="row" layout-margin>

            <div style="width: 40%; display: inline-block;"></div>
        </div>

        <h4>Flat loss</h4>
        <p>A hearing loss which is decreased in all frequency ranges is called <strong>flat loss</strong>. Even if such
            a loss is relatively uncommon it can affect (depending on the size of the loss):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the speech intelligibility</li>
            <li>the perception of environmental sounds</li>
            <li>understanding speech in noisy surroundings</li>
        </ul>
