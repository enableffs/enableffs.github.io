            <p>Recreation and leisure are important to all persons, including persons with hearing impairment. These activities are important
    for persons with hearing loss because they:</p>
        <ul><li>foster the development of a positive self esteem</li>
            <li>enhance the development of language and communication skills</li>
            <li>promote learning and development of social skills</li>
    <li>improve of the functioning of the body and its organs</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
   <p> Persons with hearing impairment therefore, need to be given equal opportunity to participate in recreation and leisure activities.
       Such activities include:</p>
        <ul><li>school clubs for instance drama, music, debate clubs</li>
            <li>sports activities</li>
            <li>classes or lessons outside school</li>
            <li>spending time with other children e.g. watching movie</li>
            <li>participating in cultural activities</li>
            <li>fitness activities</li>
            <li>youth organizationsâ€™ activities</li>
            <li>church activities</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How to encourage children with hearing impairment to participate in recreation and leisure activities</h4>
        <p>Some children with hearing loss may not take the initiative to participate in recreation and leisure activities. This
    is because they may feel shy or unsafe to join their peers with a different hearing status or lack confidence to
    communicate with them. The following strategies can help encourage such children to engage in recreation and leisure activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pair the children with peers or mentors</li>
        <li>plan activities that are relevant to their needs and age group</li>
        <li>reward the children for successfully participating in the activities</li>
            <li>establish a routine for recreation and leisure activities</li>
            <li>use equipment and/ or materials that are attractive and familiar to the children</li>
        </ul>
