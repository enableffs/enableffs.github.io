        <p>Some children with hearing loss may not take the initiative to participate in recreation and leisure activities. This
    is because they may feel shy or unsafe to join their peers with a different hearing status or lack confidence to
    communicate with them. The following strategies can help encourage such children to engage in recreation and leisure activities:</p>
        <ul><li>Pair the children with peers or mentors</li>
        <li>Plan activities that are relevant to their needs and age group</li>
        <li>Reward children for successfully participating in the activities</li>
            <li>Establish  routine for recreation and leisure activities</li>
            <li>Use equipment and/ or materials that are attractive and familiar to the children</li>
        </ul>
