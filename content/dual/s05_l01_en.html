        <p>The disability of deafblindness presents unique challenges to families, teachers, and caregivers, who must make sure that
            the person who is deafblind has access to the world beyond the limited reach of his or her eyes, ears, and fingertips.<br><br>
            The people in the environment of children or adults who are deafblind must seek to include them—moment-by-moment—in the flow of
            life and in the physical environments that surround them. If they do not, the child will be isolated and will not have the
            opportunity to grow and to learn.  If they do, the child will be afforded the opportunity to develop to his or her fullest
            potential.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites for social interaction</h3>
        <p>Social interaction with someone close is of fundamental importance to all children, and is a form of togetherness that
            unfolds independent of a developed language. This interaction ensures the child's access to mutual contact, shared emotional
            experiences and attachment. Social interaction is the basis for communicating with each other.<br><br> Social interaction is an
            underlying quality of all good communication between people of all ages and we find this in its most cultivated form in the
            early interaction between the infant and the parents. Proximity, sharing of feelings, play and pleasure are important components.
            It is through social interaction that shared attention is being formed, and this is where children learn turn taking and more
            complex communicative functions and forms functions.<br><br>
            Nursery rhymes, songs, lullabies and small stories are examples of games likes activities that many children like and can repeat
            over and over. <br><br></p>

            <h4>Important components in successful social interaction</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Positioning (regulation of proximity)</li>
        <li>Following the speed, pitch and rhythm in the child`s movement and sound</li>
        <li>Seeing the child`s expression and imitate it</li>
        <li>Affective attunement (the term is used to describe how adults express themselves in the emotional state of the child, and in
            this way they share the feelings/emotions themselves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Family and friends</h3>
        <p>The most important challenge for parents, caregivers, and teachers is to communicate meaningfully with the child who is deafblind.  Continual good
            communication will help foster his or her healthy development. Communication involves much more than mere language. Good communication can best be thought of
            as conversation.  Conversations employ body language and gestures, as well as both signed and spoken words.  A conversation with a child who is deafblind
            can begin with a partner who simply notices what the child is paying attention to at the moment and finds a way to let the child know that his or her
            interest is shared.</p>
        <h4>Establishing contact</h4>
        <p>This shared interest, once established, can become a topic around which a conversation can be built. Mutual conversational topics are typically
            established between a parent and a sighted or hearing child by making eye contact and by gestures such as pointing or nodding, or by exchanges of sounds
            and facial expressions.  Lacking significant amounts of sight and hearing, children who are deafblind will often need touch in order for them to be sure
            that their partner shares their focus of attention. The parent or teacher may, for example, touch an interesting object along with the child in a
            nondirective way. Or, the mother may imitate a child’s movements, allowing the child tactual access to that imitation, if necessary.  (This is the tactual
            equivalent of the actions of a mother who instinctively imitates her child’s babbling sounds.) Establishing a mutual interest like this will open up the
            possibility for conversational interaction.</p>
        <h4>Timing is crucial</h4>
        <p>Teachers, parents, siblings, and peers can continue conversations with children who are deafblind by learning to pause after each turn in the interaction
            to allow time for response.  These children frequently have very slow response times.</p>
            <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Respecting the child’s own timing is crucial to establishing successful interactions.</enable-quotebox>
        <p> Pausing long enough to allow the child to take a turn in the interaction, and then responding to that turn,
            this back-and-forth exchange becomes a conversation. Such conversations, repeated consistently, build relationships and become the eventual basis
            for language learning.</p>

        <h4>From nonverbal to symbolic communication</h4>
        <p>As the child who is deafblind becomes comfortable interacting nonverbally with others, she or he becomes ready to receive some form of symbolic
            communication as part of those interactions. Often it is helpful to accompany the introduction of words (spoken or signed) with the use of simple
            gestures and/or objects which serve as symbols or representations for activities.  Doing so may help a child develop the understanding that one thing
            can stand for another, and will also enable him or her to anticipate events.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Think of the many thousands of words and sentences that most children hear before they speak their own first words.  A child who is deafblind needs comparable
            language stimulation, adjusted to his or her ability to receive and make sense of it.  Parents, caregivers, and teachers face the challenge of providing an
            environment rich in language that is meaningful and accessible to the child who is deafblind.  Only with such a rich language environment will the child
            have the opportunity to acquire language herself or himself.  Those around the child can create a rich language environment by continually commenting on the
            child’s own experience using sign language, speech, or whatever symbol system is accessible to the child. These comments are best made during conversational
            interactions.  A teacher or a parent may, for example, use gesture or sign language to name the object that he or she, and the child are both touching, or
            name the movement that they share.  This naming of objects and actions, done repeatedly, may begin to give the child who is deafblind a similar
            opportunity afforded to the hearing child—that of making meaningful connections between words and the things for which they stand.</p>
