        <h3>Moja ukijumlisha moja ni sawa na tatu</h3>
        <p>Dual sensory impairment and 'deafblindness' are terms to describe a combined sight and hearing impairment.</p>
        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Dhana iliyokuwa kwa watu wengi ni kwamba watu ambao ni viziwi wasioona wanaishi
           katika ulimwengu wenye ukimya mkuu na giza totoro na kwamba mara nyingi wanazaliwa wakiwa ni viziwi wasioona.</enable-quotebox>
        <p>Ukweli ni kwamba watu wengi wenye udhaifu wa ufahamu ulio wa aina mbili wana uono masazo au masalio ya kuona au
          vyote viwili ambavyo wanaweza wakavitumia endapo tu masharti yanafuatwa.  </p>
        <ul><li>Watu walio na uono dhaifu watakuwa tegemezi katika kusikia kwa kupokea na kutafsiri sauti
          zenye uwezo wa kusaidia kuwa na picha inayotokana na macho </li>
        <li>Vivyo hivyo, watu wanaosikia kwa shida wanategemea kupata taarifa au ufahamu na msaada kwa njia ya uwezo wa kuona.  </li>
        <li>Endapo ufahamu wa kuona na kusikia umeharibika au umedhoofika ina maana kwamba mtu hawezi kufidia kwa kuwa na
           ufahamu mwingine. Moja ukijumlisha na moja ni sawa na tatu. </li></ul>
        <br>
        <p>Endapo matatizo ni mazito hivyo kwamba uwezo wa kusikia hauwezi kufidia udhaifu wa kuona na udhaifu wa kusikia hauwezi
          kufidiwa na uwezo wa kuona, neno  <strong>kiziwi asiyeona</strong> hutumika.</p>

            female teacher sits down beside her. On the other side of the teacher a deafblind teenage boy tries to thread a pearl. He succeeds threading
            without help but the teacher helps him finding another pearl to thread. <br><br>
            In another room, a deafblind teenage boy writes braille on a Perkins machine. A male teacher is sitting beside him and checks what is
            written.<br>He says: Good! Good. Correct!<br>In a close-up, the boy’s fingers push down the keys on the Perkins machine.<br>
            The teacher continues: Good. High five!<br>
            The hands of the boy and the teacher knock against each other and make a high five.<br><br>
            A teacher is making a whistle sound with a flute when a seven-eight years old girl is touching the same flute. The girl tries to make
            a whistle sound with the flute without succeeding. The teacher repeats the whistling.<br><br>
            A little girl who stands in a chair is crying.<br>
            A teacher standing beside her explains: We put her in this chair for about 30 minutes. She has not yet started walking. So, we
            are training her to stand first. Then she will learn to walk. So, this is to assist her to start.<br><br>Another little girl is

        <p>The program we work with students with sensory impairment , a dual sensory loss, deafblindness.  They have issues with
    hearing, they have issues with vision. This challenges is communication, it challenges the way they socialise, challenges
    the way they get information. <br><br>Once we had these students we tend be their partners and help them to learn how to communicate,
    help them facilitate the information that they receive from the environment and then help them to explore, to be able to learn
    what the world is like. <br><br>The dual sensory loss, that deafblindness really makes them to not understand how the world. They get
    information in fragmenting bits so it get to confuse them. They don´t know what´s happening. There is lot of information at
    once, so we tend  to structure that so they at least they get to understand what the world is like. So when it comes to know
    hands on work, they have to experience, they  have to explore. And then we continue giving communicating every time, this is
    what is happening. We also help them to anticipate what is next, what have we done, what is next. <br><br>So our kids here are happy,
    are lovely. We love working with them.</p>
