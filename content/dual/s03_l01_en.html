        <h3>Two categories of deafblindness</h3>
        <p>The definitions say nothing about how deafblindness is acquired. It is common to distinguish between
            <strong>congenital</strong> and <strong>acquired</strong> visual and hearing impairments. </p> <ul><li>The term congenital deafblindness is used when people are born deafblind
            or when their combined hearing and vision impairment occurs before spoken, signed or other visual forms of language and communication have developed.</li>
            <li>The term acquired deafblindness is used when people are born deaf or hard of hearing and later in life experience deteriorating sight.
               <br> The term is also used when people are born visual impaired or blind, and later in life experience deteriorating hearing.</li>
    </ul>


        <h3>Common causes of deafblindness</h3>
        <p>A variety of known causes for deafblindness exists.  These include congenital conditions and a wide variety of
            conditions that occur, or manifest, after birth (i.e., due to adventitious causes). Common causes of deafblindness are:</p>
        <ul><li>Birth – related conditions</li>
            <li>Congenital Rubella Syndrom</li>
            <li>Inflammation in the brain:  Corneitis/Meningitis</li>
            <li>Prematurity</li>
            <li>CHARGE syndrome</li>
            <li>Usher syndrome</li>
            <li>Other syndroms</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The most common eye diseases in deafblind children in East Africa are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cataract. The lenses are unclear. Cataract can lead to glaucoma.</li>
            <li>Glaucoma. High pressure in the eye. If not treated, can lead to blindness.</li>
            <li>Coloboma. Cleft in the eye that leads to decreased visual field and visual acuity.</li>
            <li>Optical nerve atrophy. That leads to decreased visual field and visual acuity.</li>
            <li>Retina detachment. Leads to total blindness. It is often a consequence of other eye diseases.</li>
            <li>Cerebral visual impairment. The visual impairment is not in the eye itself but in the nerves
                leading to to the visual part in the brain, or in the visual brain itself. this condition leads to problems with
                understanding visual information, problems with sustained visual attention and with sensory integration. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Common conditions that may cause deafblindness</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rubella.</strong><br>Causes may be related to mother’s pregnancy such as congenital and retinopathy of prematurity.</li>

        </div>

<p>Other causes of deafblindness are:</p>
            <li><strong>Rare diseases and infectious diseases</strong> that involves both sight and hearing impairments.</li>
            <li><strong>Random combinations of various injuries / diseases</strong> that affect both visual and auditory function.</li>
            <li><strong>Usher syndrome.</strong> People with this syndrome experience a gradual loss of their hearing or they are born hard of hearing or deaf, and sight is gradually reduced as a result of eye disease retinitis pigmentosa.
                <enable-read-more label=" Read more about Usher syndrome">
                    <h5>Usher syndrome has three clinical subtypes:</h5>
                    <ul><li><strong>Usher syndrome I.</strong> People are born profoundly deaf, and begin to lose their vision in the first decade of life. They also exhibit balance difficulties, and learn to walk slowly as children, due to problems in their vestibular system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usher syndrome II.</strong> People are not born deaf, but do have hearing loss. They do not seem to have noticeable problems with balance; they also begin to lose their vision later and may preserve some vision even into middle age.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usher syndrome III.</strong> People with are not born deaf, but experience a gradual loss of their hearing and vision; they may or may not have balance difficulties.</li>
                    </ul></enable-read-more>
            </li>
            <li><strong>CHARGE syndrome</strong> is a rare and complex condition with several serious congenital malformations that
                occur at the same time, and is one of the common causes of combined visual and hearing loss.  </li>
            <enable-read-more label=" Read more about CHARGE syndrome">
                <ul><li>The CHARGE acrynom stand for: Coloboma of the eye, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retardation of growth and development, Genital and/or urinary anomalies and Ear abnormalities and deafness. Dysfunctional brain nerves are also found, that affect balance, taste, smell, throat and tongue
                </li>
                <li>Today, it is likely that CHARGE syndrome is due to a mutation on a gene called CHD7 located to chromosome 8, but it is believed that there are several aspects of the genetic causality that have not yet been mapped.
                </li>
                <li>The syndrome is frequently diagnosed in the neonatal or prenatal period and many children experience frequent hospitalization
                    during the first year of life, partly because of congenital heart failure requiring surgical procedures.
                </li></ul>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <ul><li>Injuries in the brain nerve that affect the face muscles can cause paralysis in parts of the face. This can
                    affect mimics, which in turn increases the chance that the child is easily exposed to misunderstandings in communication.
                    This may also affect the possibilities of expressing feelings such as pain, joy, sadness and anger.
                </li>
                <li>It is energy-intensive to concentrate when vision, hearing and balance are impaired and there may be frequent breaks
                    and variation in the work tasks.
                </li>
                <li>Problems with self-regulation, functions that regulate and control emotions, thoughts and behaviors can lead to behaviors that are perceived as challenging to the environment and are difficult to understand.

        <h4>Challenges of deafblindness</h4>

        <p>Deafblindness entails major challenges and may affect all or some of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Communication</li>
            <li>Access to information, education and employment</li>
            <li>Orientation and mobility</li>
            <li>Learning</li>
            <li>Social relationships</li>
            <li>Isolation</li>
            <li>Confidence and self-esteem</li>
            <li>Independence in daily living skills</li>
            <li>Access interpreters and to aids and equipment because of cost</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deafblindness is concentration demanding and exhausting. The limitations can all cause fatigue and frustration in dealing with everyday situations.</p>
        <h4>Use of other senses</h4>
        <p>In addition to vision and hearing smell, taste and touch are the senses which is most mentioned.</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="funfact"><p>Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC) is credited with the traditional classification of the five sense organs: sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing.</p> </enable-grey-box>
        <p>Humans also have awareness of balance, pressure, temperature, pain, motion and awareness of the position and movement of the parts of the body (the sense of kinesthesia).<br><br>
            <enable-video youtube-id="lofZBB7wNso"></enable-video>
            <br>
    <h4>The tactile sense</h4>
            <p><strong>The sense of touch</strong> or <strong>the tactile sense</strong> is of
            special importance for people with visual and hearing impairment. Touch is distributed throughout the body and nerve endings
            in the skin and other parts of the body which transmit sensations to the brain. Some parts of the body are more sensitive than others.
            The fingertips are among the organs with the greatest concentration of nerve endings and therefore of great importance of the deafblind.</p>

        <enable-read-more label="Mary Maragia about the use of tactile sense">

            <p>The sense of touch is the really, really primary mode for the students with deaf blindness since their hearing and
                the vision have been limited. So they tend to use these other senses, the sense of smell, the sense of touch, the
                support senses like residual hearing and their residual sight. So when it comes to tactile we believe or we know
                that there are so many nerves, sensory nerves in their thumbs/pumps (fingertips?). So, we still need to stimulate
                their sense of touch and then we expose them to a variety of activities so they can be able to distinguish various
                activities, distinguish people, distinguish you know, like my identify, they know you are Mary, they know you are a
                professor, they can know somebody else. They are very good at detecting or getting to determinate that this is
                different from this. So our role as teachers is to provide an enabling opportunity and really give them an
                opportunity. We help them to give them a number of repetitions and then we keep reinforcing and encouraging the
                students. So we go for a high five, a high ten, you are wonderful, you are awesome. So the students tend to feel
                – oooh, the teacher understood me. So once I am happy as a teacher, as I interact with the students, the student
                will notice. The day I am not good, they will notice that the teacher today is not, nothing will work that day.
                But the moment they get - oooh, the teacher is here for me -, so again deafblindness is a lot of contact. Some of
                the students really want the contact, so once they know you are there, they thrust they are safe. Without someone
                near, they will really some of them start throwing themselves, biting themselves, hitting themselves; poke in their
                eyes. So once we available ourselves as partners or as teachers we got to work with them well and they stop this
                manner and this injurious behaviour.</p>
