        <h3>Two categories of deafblindness</h3>
        <p>The definitions say nothing about how deafblindness is acquired. It is common to distinguish between
            <strong>congenital</strong> and <strong>acquired</strong> visual and hearing impairments. </p> <ul><li>The term congenital deafblindness is used when people are born deafblind
            or when their combined hearing and vision impairment occurs before spoken, signed or other visual forms of language and communication have developed.</li>
            <li>The term acquired deafblindness is used when people are born deaf or hard of hearing and later in life experience deteriorating sight.
               <br> The term is also used when people are born visual impaired or blind, and later in life experience deteriorating hearing.</li>
    </ul>


        <h4>Common conditions that may cause deafblindness</h4>
        <p>A variety of known causes for deafblindness exists. These include congenital conditions and a wide variety of
            conditions that occur or manifest after birth.</p>
        <p>The most common conditions are:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Prematurity</strong> is a birth related conditions. A baby born at less than 37 weeks’ gestation is considered
            premature. As a general rule, the more premature an infant and the smaller the birth weight, the greater The risk of
            complications are greater when the infants has an extremely low birth weight (1000 grams).  They are more susceptible
            to possible complications of a premature birth.  Some premature infants have ongoing medical problems which could
            involve the sensory system (including vision and hearing problems). These medical problems could extend from
            childhood into adulthood.
            <enable-read-more label="Read more about prematurity">
                <strong>Vision</strong><br>It is thought that changes in the oxygen exposure
                of the infant in the nursery can cause a disruption in the process of the eye developing naturally. This disruption
                can result in an eye condition called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In some cases, may be treatable while in
                other cases may not be successful. If treatment is not an option or is not successful, then it may lead to
                retinal detachment and blindness.  Infants with ROP are also at a greater risk for having eye conditions such
                as myopia, strabismus, amblyopia and glaucoma.<br><br><strong>Hearing</strong><br>Several things can cause varying
                degrees of hearing loss in premature infants. In prematurity, the underdeveloped blood vessels of the inner ear can
                easily hemorrhage.  It could decrease the blood supply to the organ of corti, causing irreversible damage to the
                cells in this area. Other risk factors which can contribute to hearing loss in premature infants include hypoxia,
                hyperbilirubinemia, or physical trauma at birth.<br> <br>

            <li><strong>Inflammation in the brain</strong> as corneitis and meningitis. Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissue
                lining of the brain and spinal cord.  There are two broad categories of meningitis; viral and bacterial. The symptoms
                may include nausea, vomiting, discomfort looking into bright lights, confusion, loss of balance and sleepiness.
                It can cause vision and cortical visual problems such as deafness, brain damage, or seizures among others.
                A person who becomes sick with bacterial meningitis needs immediate medical treatment.  In rare cases, fungal
                meningitis can cause dangerous form of meningitis for premature babies.  Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial
                meningitis.<br>

        <enable-read-more label="Read more eye diseases">
        <p><strong>The most common eye diseases in deafblind children in East Africa are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cataract. The lenses are unclear. Cataract can lead to glaucoma.</li>
            <li>Glaucoma. High pressure in the eye. If not treated, can lead to blindness.</li>
            <li>Coloboma. Cleft in the eye that leads to decreased visual field and visual acuity.</li>
            <li>Optical nerve atrophy. That leads to decreased visual field and visual acuity.</li>
            <li>Retina detachment. Leads to total blindness. It is often a consequence of other eye diseases.</li>
            <li>Cerebral visual impairment. The visual impairment is not in the eye itself but in the nerves
                leading to to the visual part in the brain, or in the visual brain itself. this condition leads to problems with
                understanding visual information, problems with sustained visual attention and with sensory integration. </li>

        <h4>Ear diseases among deafblind children in East Africa</h4>
        <enable-read-more label="Read more about ear diseases"><p>Many different conditions lead to partial and total deafness include
            ear infections, fluid buildup behind the ear drum, holes in the ear drum, and problems with the middle ear bones that can
            cause deafness from conductive hearing loss. In rare cases, tumours can also cause conductive hearing loss – they block
            sound waves from getting into the inner ear.<br>
            Birth defects and diseases passed on by genes can do this too.  Genetics is one cause of sensorineural hearing loss.
        Half of all cases of profound deafness in children have a genetic source.</p>

        <h4>Challenges of deafblindness</h4>

        <p>Deafblindness entails major challenges and may affect all or some of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Communication</strong><br>This can impair deafblind people during interaction with people around them, sharing knowledge and information; exchanging
                greetings; conveying needs; and freely expressing their feelings to enable them make informed choices in the environment.  Development of
                formal language is difficult.</li>
            <li><strong>Access to information, education and employment</strong><br> They are always faced with the challenge of getting feedback, making career choices and access
                to information, if they don’t get the right support</li>
            <li><strong>Orientation and mobility</strong> <br>Good orientation and mobility skills is key to giving people independence and the opportunity to maintain a
                healthy lifestyle. Reduced mobility skills restrict persons with deablindness to access activities of daily living and moving safely to where one
                wants to go.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning</strong> <br>The learning processes can be demanding, depending on individual abilities and the severity of the impairment. For example,
                following routines during ADLs.  Essential information is missed and incidental learning is greatly limited.</li>
            <li><strong>Social relationships</strong> <br>Social relationships create social bonds through interaction.  Lack of this may lead to behavioral change and challenges
                in adapting to the new environment.  They may detach themselves and avoid interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation</strong> <br>Social skills cannot be learnt in isolation.  Positive peer interaction is important.  Lack of access to complete visual and
                auditory information results in varying degrees of isolation and disconnection from the world around them.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence and self-esteem</strong><br> The challenges of not making new friends, explore new ideas and activities, reach out to help others, take on greater
                responsibility as they mature.</li>
            <li><strong>Independence in daily living skills</strong> <br>Living independently will be difficult or even impossible for learners who are deafblind without
                receiving some level of support from a partner.</li>
            <li><strong>Access interpreters and to aids and equipment because of cost</strong> <br>Accessing support services like sign language/tactile interpretation,
                or assistive devices at high costs hinders persons with deafblindness from accessing information, and participating fully in day-to-day activities,
                or even activities of daily living.</li>
        </ul>
        <enable-read-more label="Other challenges associated with deafblindness may include">

        <ul>
                <li>Injuries in the brain nerves that affect the face muscles can cause paralysis in parts of the face. This can affect mimics, which in turn

        <p>Deafblindness is concentration demanding and exhausting. The limitations can all cause fatigue and frustration in dealing with everyday situations.</p>
        <h4>Use of other senses</h4>
        <p>In addition to vision and hearing smell, taste and touch are the senses which is most mentioned.</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="funfact"><p>Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC) is credited with the traditional classification of the five sense organs: sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing.</p> </enable-grey-box>

            who are deafblind are playing in the self-made pool, making bobbles and foam. A teacher helps one of the children in the water. The children are moving after each other like train wagons in a
            circle. The children enjoy the activity in the water.<br><br>

            Off screen the teacher says:<br>
            First of all, there is the sensory stimulation. Because our skins tactile sense goes with the whole skin. When they swim, the water is on to their whole body and they get that relief
            sometimes. Most of them. It helps very much in releasing their muscles. By the end of the activity they are relaxed and free. And they enjoy the water. So, it is a social activity that
            helps us into introducing other things like communication.<br><br>
            In a wider picture, we see around ten children and four teachers interact in the pool.<br><br>

            A close picture of the teacher is shown. On screen the teacher continues :
            And we can ask them to stand up. It’s another physical activity. Some of them cannot run around and we cannot carry them up, and let them run. But in the water, we can ask them to
            kick, and they can kick the water and they feel like the water is bubbling and they feel that, yes! It’s fun!<br><br>

            The children continue playing in the water making bubbles.<br><br>

            Off-screen the teacher continues:<br>
            To some of the students it’s a new activity. So, what we need is to expose them to the activity. When they realize that the rest of the people are enjoying, then
            with time they can catch up.<br><br>

            A little girl is not familiar to the activity and cries when she is exposed to the water.<br><br>

            The teacher continues:<br>
            Because even those of soon enjoying they started like that. But when they realize that even the teacher is with them, and you, the teacher, is also swimming
            together with them.<br><br>

            A boy is standing in the water hand in hand with a teacher.<br><br>

            The teacher continues:<br>
            So, they come up together, and they start to initiate. So, it’s our responsibility as teachers, as people working with them to expose them to as many experiences as possible.

    <h4>The tactile sense</h4>
            <p><strong>The sense of touch</strong> or <strong>the tactile sense</strong> is of
            special importance for people with visual and hearing impairment. Touch is distributed throughout the body and nerve endings
            in the skin and other parts of the body which transmit sensations to the brain. Some parts of the body are more sensitive than others.
            The fingertips are among the organs with the greatest concentration of nerve endings and therefore of great importance of the deafblind.</p>

        <enable-read-more label="Mary Maragia about the use of tactile sense">

            <p>The sense of touch is the really, really primary mode for the students with deaf blindness since their hearing and
                the vision have been limited. So they tend to use these other senses, the sense of smell, the sense of touch, the
                support senses like residual hearing and their residual sight. So when it comes to tactile we believe or we know
                that there are so many nerves, sensory nerves in their thumbs/pumps (fingertips?). So, we still need to stimulate
                their sense of touch and then we expose them to a variety of activities so they can be able to distinguish various
                activities, distinguish people, distinguish you know, like my identity, they know you are Mary, they know you are a
                professor, they can know somebody else. They are very good at detecting or getting to determinate that this is
                different from this. So our role as teachers is to provide an enabling opportunity and really give them an
                opportunity. We help them to give them a number of repetitions and then we keep reinforcing and encouraging the
                students. So we go for a high five, a high ten, you are wonderful, you are awesome. So the students tend to feel
                – oooh, the teacher understood me. So once I am happy as a teacher, as I interact with the students, the student
                will notice. The day I am not good, they will notice that the teacher today is not, nothing will work that day.
                But the moment they get - oooh, the teacher is here for me -, so again deafblindness is a lot of contact. Some of
                the students really want the contact, so once they know you are there, they thrust they are safe. Without someone
                near, they will really some of them start throwing themselves, biting themselves, hitting themselves; poke in their
                eyes. So once we available ourselves as partners or as teachers we got to work with them well and they stop this
                manner and this injurious behaviour.</p>
