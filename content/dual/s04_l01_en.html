        <h3>What is communication?</h3>
        <p>Communication means to share information; emotions, expressions, ideas and memories. It happens between two or more partners where the partners are active in the process and together they co-create or develop communication.</p>
        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Humans are social beings and communication with others is an essential and important aspect of our lives.</enable-quotebox>

        <p>The ability to communicate is essential to convey our opinions, needs and feelings. Through communication we create social
            relations and make us participate in the life that surround us.<br>

            Communication difficulties appear primarily when the hearing is impaired. If the sight is reduced too, the ability to
            communicate residues further.</p>
       <h3>What is communication used for?</h3>
        <p>Communication is used for basic, social interplay to ensure that the person accesses natural contact, shared
            emotional experiences and attachment.  Communication can be useful for persons with deafblindnesss in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>obtaining personal needs.</li>
        <li>informing about what has already happened, what is happening and what is going to happen.</li>
        <li>commenting on the interest of the person with deafblindness.</li>
        <li>sharing experiences in a conversation.<br> To communicate about what you experience together is important for developing self-esteem and for developing communication further.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why communication is the main focus in services for persons with deafblindess</h3>
        <p>Communication is the main goal because it includes emotional, social and cognitive development. Communication is important because it:</p>
        <ul><li>creates bonding with parents, family members, houseparents and teachers.</li>
        <li>promotes social interaction. The deafblind child learns to establish and sustain contact and social rules like turn-taking.</li>
        <li>support the development of self-esteem. The child feels that she can master things on her own, she is understood and appreciated by
            her partner and she can influence his/her own life.</li>
        <li>builds relationships and awareness of other persons. It is the precondition for developing empathy.</li>
        <li> promotes understanding of  the physical and social surroundings, building up mental images and concepts of what they experience.</li></ul>

        <h3>Main methods of communication</h3>
        <enable-image picname="communicationthreegirls.jpg" picalt=""></enable-image>
        <p>Persons with deafblindess have many different ways of communication. The methods they use vary, depending on the causes and function of
            their combined vision and hearing loss, their backgrounds, and their education.</p>

        <p>The main methods of communication with a person with deafblindness or between two deafblind people are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tactile Sign Language</strong><br>The person with deafblindness puts his or her hands over the signer’s hands to feel the shape,
            movement and location of the signs. See an example of tactile sign language in
                <enable-link href="https://youtu.be/QBtSrqKAJR0"> this Spanish-speaking video</enable-link>.</li>
           <li><strong>Sign language (based on visual communication)</strong> This is a visual mode of communication expressed by the use of hands,
               facial expression and body movements. It has its own rules of grammar, structure and the way of expression.</li>
            <li><strong>Tactile Fingerspelling</strong><br>The person with deafblindness may prefer to put his or her hand over the
                fingerspelling hand, or on the signer’s palm, or cup his or her hand around the signer’s hand. Usually people
                who are deaflbind prefer tactile fingerspelling because sometimes sign language can be difficult to learn.</li>
            <li><strong>Screen Braille Communicator</strong> (digital)<br>
              <p> The Screen Braille Communicator is a communication device designed for use by
                individuals who are deaf blind to communicate with the sighted persons</p>

              </li>
            <li><strong>Writers and tactile interpreters</strong><br>
            <p> These are people who interpret tactile communication and oral communication to
               facilitate communication between those who are blind and deaf or hard of hearing
               and other people. The tactile interpreter puts a hand either on top of or below
               the other person's hand in
              order to convey and receive information from the person who is deaf blind.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Note takers</strong> <br>
              <p> Note takers are devices that are used by persons who are deafblind to take notes.
                These can also be people who assit to take notes for persons who find difficulties in writing.

            </li>

            <li><strong>Haptic communication</strong><br>The idea behind the haptic communication is to share visual
              and auditory information from the environment, using the haptic signals in parallel with the ordinary
              communication. It is meant to serve as a complement to the spoken or signed language in a
                communication situation.<br> Haptic communication does not replace speech or sign language. It is about creating meaning
                and context, to get a better picture of the situation and the room you are in.<br> It will strengthen and complement
                other kinds of communication between human beings.<br>
                Haptic communication takes place through the body contact at neutral zones in the body like back, shoulder, hand,
                knee or foot. It is bounded to the situation, context, place and orientation.</li></ul>

               put their thumb on the other person’s chin, and their fingers on the other
               person’s cheek to feel the vibrations of the person’s voice and the movement of their lips.

        <h3>Identification of ways of communication among new learners </h3>
        <p>The first step in communicative development is to establish and maintain the contact.
          The first communicative expressions of the
            child will be natural expressions which has to be discovered and reacted upon by the
            partner. The partner reacts on all the
            ways the child can express himself and tries to introduce more and more advanced
            communication systems leading to sign
            language for the children that have good cognitive capacities.</p>

        <enable-read-more label="Mary Maragia about communication">

            <p>Communication is our key here. So once we are able to attune ourselves to the level of the student. When the student is
                brought, the parents brings the student, we tend to ask the parents: How do you communicate with the student at home?<br>
                So we get really the basic, the really simple ways. How the student gets their needs done (?). How the student get their
                want met?<br>TThen from there now we pick it and start helping modern (?)the communication of the student. So like we, most
                of the time you find the student their communication yet around their body. So it up to (?)us to help them with more
                activities. The activities help them to now start moving and also trying to interact. So, like we tend to look a: What
                is the student interested in? So, once we have known the  learners interest, we have known the student’s´ strength and how
                they communicate. So it our responsibility now to start using symbols. We start using the whatever more we have seen
                working with the student. For example, you saw Lousie is able to sign, she is a very good signer, so she passed the level
                of using symbols or using objects of reference. So like for Lousie we will sign for her. If it is Cedric, we will use speech, at the same time sign, because he has voice. Sometimes he can use a speech. So once we are able to understand
                his way of communication, we will instruct the student specifically geared to what he or her communicate. If it is for the
                small boy Victor, like we also get him and we use tactile signs. So we hold his hands and tell him what is next. So if
                something is trouble, like we tend to use total communication and also add other strategies to make it work for the student.</p>

                Those one are not interested, then can everybody tell (?) this one is crying. Then they are not. <br>There are those who
                want to go for the toilet. They can tell. Much as (?) they do not have a formal language that you can tell the child wants
                to go, because they know we don’t do it in the water. We have to do it the toilet. So it is a good way for expression
                and receiving receptions on the children.</p>

        <h4>Each individual is different</h4>
        <p>To maintain the contact with others, sound residues needs to be recovered as much
            as possible. Even if both hearing and vision are lost, the communication with others can be maintained. Be aware of each
            individual is different and requires individual adaptations and communication methods.</p>
