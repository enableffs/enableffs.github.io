        <h3>What is Deafblindness</h3>
        <p>The National Association of the Deafblind in Uganda defines the term Deafblindness as follows:</p>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote"><p>
            Deafblindness is a unique impairment whereby a person has a combination of varying degrees of hearing and sight loss. </p></enable-grey-box>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="quote"><p>Deafblindness is a distinct disability.
            Deafblindness is a combined vision and hearing disability. It limits activities of a person and restricts
            full participation in society to such a degree that society is required to facilitate specific services, environmental
            alterations and/or technology.</p></enable-grey-box>


        <p>For clarifying the definition some comments are added.</p>
        <enable-read-more label=" Read more about these comments">
            <ol><li>Vision and hearing are central in getting information. Therefore a decrease in the function of these two senses that carry information from distance increases the need to use senses that are confined to information within reach (tactile, kinaesthetic, haptic, smell and taste), as well as leaning on memory and deduction.</li>
                <li>The need for specific alterations regarding environment and services depends on
                    <ul>
                        <li>the time of on-set in relation to communicative development and language acquisition</li>
                        <li>the degree of the hearing and vision disability, whether it is combined with other disabilities </li>
                    </ul>whether it is stable or progressive. </li>
                <li>A person with Deafblindness may be more disabled in one activity and less disabled in another activity. Therefore, each activity and participation in it needs to be assessed separately. Variation in functioning within each activity and participation in it may also be caused by environmental conditions and by internal personal factors. </li>
                <li>Deafblindness causes varying needs for co-creating alterations in all activities and especially in
                    <ul><li>all kinds of information;</li>
                        <li>social interaction and communication;</li>
                        <li>spatial orientation and moving around freely; </li>
                        <li>activities of daily life which are effort demanding </li>
                        <li>near-activities including reading and writing. </li></ul>

                    Co-creating means that the person with Deafblindness and the environment are equally involved. The responsibility for this to occur lies on society. </li>
                <li>An interdisciplinary approach including specific know-how related to Deafblindness is needed in service delivery and environmental alterations.</li>

        <h3>Identifying and understanding a Deafblind person</h3>
        <p> Very few children are totally Deafblind. Usually the child will have residual hearing or very poor vision. Sometimes the child has additional impairments requiring special training.
            Ideally, the earlier the impairment is detected and interventions made, the better chance for the child to overcome the impairment.</p>
        <enable-grey-box ><p>If a child has some of these characteristics, it may be a sign of dual sensory impairment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The child hesitates or stumbles in the stairs or playground.</li>
            <li> The child avoids or has problems with some games. For example in ball games, he / she may not be able to see the ball and bumps on it.</li>
            <li> The child would like to hold someone in his hand when it gets dark, for example in the evening.
            <li>The child avoids or withdraws from social situations because it is difficult to keep up with the conversation.</li>
            <li>The child often complains about headache and becomes quickly tired. He / she needs breaks to get through the day.</li>
            <li>The child has difficulty following in conversations around the dinner table.</li>
        </ul>

<p>The group of children with Deafblindness is very heterogeneous. It can be difficult to identify children with Deafblindness and to estimate the significance of
    the sensory loss for the child’s development.  Deafblindness limits the activities of a person
    and restricts full participation in society to a degree which requires that society compensates by means of specific services, environmental alterations
    and /or technology.<br>Deafblindness is not only determined by objective vision and hearing tests, but also an estimate of the functioning of the senses.
    It is important to first understand the two terms visual impairment and hearing impairment since they are used concurrently in the field
    of Deafblindness.
    <br><br>
    Individuals with visual impairments have varying degrees of vision-use for tasks that typically require vision.  While some individuals
    have to use other channels (e.g. auditory and tactile ones) to acquire information, others use vision but only to supplement information acquired through other channels.
    Another group of individuals with visual impairments includes persons who mainly use eyes to acquire input that is typically acquired through vision but supplement
    this with input from tactile, auditory, and other senses.</p>
        </enable-read-more>
        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Independence and self-reliance are possible for the persons with Deafblindness. Milestones are slower, may be very slow for some, but they can gain them.</enable-quotebox>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>Due to the complexity of Deafblindness, assessment must be done in three levels: medical, functional and in daily
            life situations.<br>Even if the medical examinations are very important, it is not covered here in this website.<br>The
            functional assessment includes observation of how the senses are functioning. The parents need to be involved in this
            process because they are able to communicate and interpret the child´s reactions.<br><br>Assessment of the daily
            life situations considers how the child learn and how the child gather information from other
            persons. Through this assessment the learning style of the child will be identified.</p>
        <enable-read-more label="Some case studies">
        <enable-grey-box ><h5>Mary's case</h5><p>"Mary" was 7 years old when she was referred for placement. She is a
            congenital total Deafblind child, she cannot walk, chew nor move about in the environment.  She objects by resisting,
            screaming, fighting or biting whenever she is introduced to a new activity.  Her activities were planned in such a way
            that they follow one another systematically and always as a routine.  After some time, she got used to it and on the
            contrary to objecting she got used to the activities until sometimes she refuses to stop and come out of every activity she
            participates in.</p><br>
            <h5>Chausiku . A "case study" from Sense International</h5><p>Chausiku aged seven, lives in a village in Tanzania

                She had a tough start to life and as the fifth of seven children there was a lot of competition for attention. Due to her disability she struggled to be a part of the family and was often left alone for long periods of time.

                When a Sense International support worker first identified Chausiku as Deafblind she couldn’t walk or eat without support. Her parents had no idea what the cause of her disability was or that she couldn’t see or hear and had given up trying to communicate with her.

                Over the last two years a support worker has visited the family each week and is teaching Chausiku a form of tactile communication to help her communicate with her family. She has made huge progress and is now able to play with her brothers and sisters.

            <div style="width: 60%;display: inline-block;"><p>When new  learners start at Kilimani Deafblind Unit they have to go through a comprehensive assessment to identify their ways of
    communicating, learning styles and which activities they enjoy. Based on this information individual educational programs are created.<br>Listen to Mary Maragia about the importance of individual educational programs.</p></div>

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview about individual educational programs">
<p>Once a learner  comes to us after they have been placed in our program,
   as teachers we tend to do functional assessment. How does
    the learner  function?  How does the learner  use his residual
    vision? How does the learner  use his residual hearing? How is a
    learner  doing in an activity?<br>
    From there, once we have done that assessment is when we are
    able to develop an individual educational program. It is a visual
    summary of who the learner  is. So what we do is, we tend to ask from the parents.
<br>
    How does the learner  communicate?<br>The next bit: What is the learning style? how does
    the learner  learn? So you will find Louise is a signer so would she benefit from sign language, from movement, from support
    senses, from tactile; that is the sense of touch.
<br>
    So once we have that the next: What are some of the activities the partner can do with the learner? Louise can swim, Louise can
    do adapted physical education. She is good at weaving, beauty therapy, in massage. So  we get the activities that we will engage
    the learner  in.
    <br>The next, as a partner, as a teacher. How am I going to communicate with Louise? I will use tactile sign, I will use total
    communication, I will use you know, when she doesn't understand real objects. So that is the kind of the four things.

            <div style="width: 0%; display: inline-block;"></div>
        </div>


<h3>Future plans for the  learners</h3>
<p>After the individual educational programs are in place, the staff at
   Kilimani develop a future plan  for each learner  based on
    the parents concern, the strength of the learner , the interest of the
     learner  and the program at Kilimani.<br> For instance Cedric´s
    parents want him to express himself more, to use his voice. The plan
     for Cedric is to use braille and join the mainstream class because
    he good at math and he try to listen. <br>Based on the plan the staff
     work out recommendations for adaptation- what is needed to be
    done so that the learner  can benefit? Cedric needs braille, orientation and mobility,
     an adapted desk and other needs that Kilimani can
    support him with to be able to benefit.</p>
 <h3>Portfolios for older  learners</h3>
 <p>The system with Individual Educational Programs (IEP) are used for older  learners too. At Sikri Vocational Training Centre
     for the Deaf and Blind in Kenya the term "educational programs" are replaced with the term "portfolio".<br>The portfolio
     describes the  learners'
     cognitive capacity, the  learners' behaviour, the social interaction, the communication skills, the disability level and the
      learners' vocational skills. The portfolio ends with a future prospect.<br>See some examples of portfolios below:</p>
