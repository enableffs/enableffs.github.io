        <ul><li><strong>Does the word “Deafblind” mean a person is fully deaf and fully blind?</strong><br>
            No. Most people who are Deafblind have a combination of varying levels of  vision and hearing loss.
            They can be categorised as follows: <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Low vision and profound hearing loss</li>
              <li>Profound visual loss and hard of hearing</li>
              <li>Low vision and hard of hearing</li>
              <li>Profound visual loss (blind) and profound hearing loss (deaf)</li>
            </ul>

             <enable-read-more label="Read more">They usually have some useful but not always reliable vision and hearing.
            Some people have little or no useable hearing and vision. For example, a person may be born deaf or hard of hearing and loses his or her vision later in life.
            Another person may grow up as a blind or visually impaired person and experience a hearing loss later. Some people are born with combined vision and
            hearing loss, or lose their vision and hearing at an early age.<br>Two federal definitions of Deafblindness exist. One is used in primarily in education,
            and the other in rehabilitation.<br>

        <li><strong>How many Deafblind people are there in the East African region?</strong><br>
            Currently the National Bureaus of Statistics in the three East African countries has not officially
            provided an up-to-date statistics of persons with Deafblindness. However, Sense International has
            provided some statistics below.<enable-read-more label="Read more">Sense
            International has estimated the numbers of persons with Deafblindness in Uganda to be 14.000 of a
                population of 35 million people. In Kenya 17.000 persons
            of a population of 42 million are estimated to be Deafblind and in Tanzania the estimated the
                numbers of persons with Deafblindness is 18.600.
           Tanzania has a population of 46 million people.</enable-read-more></li>

            <li><strong>How do people become Deafblind?</strong><br>
            About 50 percent of people in the Deafblind community have Usher Syndrome. This is a genetic condition where a person is born deaf or hard of hearing
             and loses his or her vision later on in life from retinitis pigmentosa (RP).<br>
            Other common causes of Deafblindness include birth trauma, optic nerve atrophy, cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.
            Some people may be born with both hearing and visual impairments through birth trauma or rare causes such as CHARGE Syndrome or cortical visual impairment.
            Others may become Deafblind through accidents or illnesses.

            <li><strong>What activities can Deafblind people do?</strong><br>
            People who are Deafblind have a wide variety of both vision and hearing loss. They come from different social, vocational and educational backgrounds.
            They have many jobs and roles: teachers, professors, counselors, homemakers, agency directors, business executives, government workers, and others.
            Some have their own businesses. Others are  learners, and still others are retired.</li>

            <li><strong>How do Deafblind people get around?</strong><br> Deafblind people can often travel independently, and/or with family, friends or support service providers (SSPs).
            Many use public transportation–buses public commuter taxis or subways, especially if they live in an area where public transportation is available. They also
            use paratransit–vans or special taxis, especially if they live in rural areas or in an area where public transit is not available. Some may use car or van
            pools. Others may depend on family and friends for transportation, or travel on foot if they live within walking distance of where they need to go.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>How do Deafblind people communicate?</strong><br>Deafblind people use many different ways to communicate. They use sign language
            (adapted to fit their visual field), tactile sign language, tracking, tactile fingerspelling, print on palm, tadoma, Braille, speech, and speech reading.
            The communication methods vary with each person, depending on the causes of their combined vision and hearing loss, their background, and their education.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>What kind of technology or equipment do Deafblind people use?</strong><br>Deafblind people use many types of technology and equipment in their daily lives.
            Examples include mobility canes, closed circuit televisions (CCTV), Brailler, Braille TTYs (teletypewriter), TTYs with large print displays, and Braille or large print watches
            or clocks, to name only a few.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Where and how can Deafblind people learn how to be independent?</strong><br>Deafblind people can get training to learn to become
                independent. One example is training in orientation and mobility so they can learn to travel independently. Also, Deafblind people can take
                training classes at places such as: <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>home</li>
                  <li>School</li>
                  <li>National Associations and organizations</li>
                  <li>National rehabilitation centers</li>
                  <li>International organizations such as: Helen Keller National Center
                 (HKNC) in the United States of America, the national Association for
                  Deafblind youth and adults in your country like for the case of Uganda, Tanzania and
                 Kenya in East Africa.

            <li><strong>How can I know if I have a vision and hearing loss?</strong><br>

              You can make an appointment with your eye doctor to get your eyes checked. You can also get a
                hearing test. To get a hearing test, you can see an audiologist or go to an audiology clinic near your home.</li>
