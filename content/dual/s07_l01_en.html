     <h3>Uganda</h3>
        <p>Currently there is no specifically approved policy on special needs education for the deafblind people in Uganda. However, there are general policies that cater
            for all persons with disabilities generally.  A policy on special needs education is still at draft stage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The government of Uganda has taken a number of legislative and policy steps that indicate commitment to advancing the rights of persons with disabilities,
            including persons with deafblindness.</p>
        <h4>Conventions and treaties at international level</h4>
        <p>In terms of international instruments, these steps include signing and ratifying:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)
        <enable-read-more label="Read more">Signing and ratifying (in 2008) the <enable-link href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml">United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)</enable-link> and the optional protocol,
    the first international, legally binding treaty aimed at protecting the human rights of persons with disabilities. An initial State party report to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
    was delivered by Uganda in 2013 (due in 2010), including a range of commitments for future action. The civil society has developed an alternative Report.</enable-read-more></li>
<li>The Mine Ban Treaty <enable-read-more label="Read more">Signing and ratifying the <enable-link href="http://www.icbl.org/media/604037/treatyenglish.pdf">Mine Ban Treaty </enable-link>in 2001</enable-read-more>
</li>
    <p>Uganda has also signed and ratified other treaties that advance the rights of people, including those with disabilities. The treaties
        make some reference to protecting the rights of persons with disabilities to fair treatment, appropriate care, inclusion and
        full participation in society.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><enable-link href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/crc.pdf">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</enable-link></li>

        (2012) outlining joint policy commitments in line with the CRPD and country level recommendations.</p>
    <li>National Plan of Action for the African Decade of Persons with Disabilities<enable-read-more label="Read more">Uganda adopted a National Plan of Action for the African
        Decade of Persons with Disabilities already in 2005, with a budget of 1.8 million Uganda shillings. The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights has drafted
        a <enable-link href="http://www.achpr.org/news/2014/04/d121">Protocol on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</enable-link>. It was released for comment in
        April 2014 and once finalized, is likely to become part of Uganda’s policy framework for advancing disability rights. Other important upcoming tools in 2014 are

</ul>
        <h4>Conventions and treaties at Uganda national level</h4>
    <p>In terms of national laws and policies, the following have the most direct bearing on the rights of persons with disabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><enable-link href="https://www.google.no/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwid4s3jvM_MAhULCSwKHQm7AOkQFggqMAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uganda.at%2FGeschichte%2Fverfassung_der_republik_Uganda_2008.pdf&usg=AFQjCNE9OR7L18k_gDG8_I1K4sT7Fw6y4Q">
                The Uganda Constitution of 1995</enable-link>  recognises the rights of persons with disabilities, including persons with
                deafblindness and outlines these rights in quite detail. <br>It stipulates that the State shall promote the development of
                sign language for the deaf, provide education for all (article 20) and include and affirmative action representation of
                persons with disabilities in the Parliament (article 75).  It provides for equality and prohibits discrimination against all
                persons and specifically includes persons with disabilities (article 21).
                <br>It further stipulates that the State shall take affirmative action in favour of marginalized groups (including
                persons with disabilities where deafblind persons are inclusive) and shall make laws for the fulfillment of this clause,
                including laws to establish and Equal Opportunities Commission (article 32). Furthermore, it
        provides for the rights of persons with disabilities to respect and human dignity. It also imposes a duty on the state to make laws appropriate for the protection
        of persons with disabilities (article 35). </li>

                rights-based approach.  It also provides for representation of PWD in decision-making bodies (reserved seats) in all administrative
        levels, including local councils.  The <enable-link href="http://gov.ug/about-uganda/government-policies/national-policy-disability">National Policy on Disability in

                as certain parts have costly implications allowing considerable tax reduction: 10 per cent to
        companies employing more than 15 persons with disabilities.  The tax was reduced to 2 per cent and persons with disabilities given an annual special grant of
        30 million UGX for each district to support the socio-economic development and employment. <br> In March 2012, civil society launched a comprehensive Proposal to
        Amendments of the Persons with Disabilities Act of 2006 in order to ensure full domestication of the CRPD.  The proposal was spearheaded by the Uganda
        National Association of the Deaf (UNAD), Legal Action for Persons with Disabilities (LAPD) and Mental Health Uganda (MHU). The proposal is pending. </li>

        <p>The National Policy on Disability aims at providing conducive environment for people with disabilities to engage in productive
            work for their development and the utilization of available resources for improved service delivery. Currently there is no
            specifically approved policy on special needs education for the deafblind people in Tanzania. However, Tanzania has adopted
            and implemented a number of laws, policies and standards pertaining to people with disabilities, including their right to
            productive and decent work, vocational training and basic services. The 1977 Constitution and its amendments prohibit
