3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.260
A hen, very good.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.340
Now, if this is a hen we looked at this is a what?

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.305

My school is Bishop Willis Demonstration School which is an inclusive school.

16
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.620
It is inclusive in a way that has the normal children and the special needs education children.

17
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.160
We include them in the normal classes so at least they should not feel isolated.

18
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.360

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.880

21
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.380
train them in  how to read and how to write using the braille machine.

22
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.300
And they have about five teachers who are specialists

23
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.660
