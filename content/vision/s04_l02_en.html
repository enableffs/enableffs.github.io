<p>Early intervention can mean both interventions in early years of human life or intervention in early stages of visual loss.</p>
<enable-grey-box e-type="quote">Early intervention is extremely important. The reason is: if it is in children then it is likely possible to prepare interventions which may help the child.</enable-grey-box>

<p>If the child is at school, special programs will be effective for child development in all domains intellectual, physical, social and emotional.</p>

<p>In case the early intervention is to an adult who has just started developing signs of visual impairment, there is a possibility to handle the situation.</p>
<h4>Screening</h4>
<p>The most important way of getting to know whether a person has vision problem is through <strong>screening</strong>.</p>
<p>This refers to a method of identifying children with visual impairment or eye conditions that are likely to lead to visual impairment. The aim of screening is to identify the visual problem. Both children and adults can undergo vision screening.</p>
<p>Through screening the following may be categories of problems to be identified:</p> 
<ul><li>neonatal conditions</li>
<li>risk factors</li>
<li>refractive errors</li>
<li>colour vision abnormalities</li>
</ul>
