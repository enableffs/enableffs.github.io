        <p>Vision can simply refer to the ability to see. This ability is enabled by the sensory system.
            The sensory system is a part of the nervous system, and is responsible for processing vision sensory information.

            What the eye sees is what we refer to as sensory information.</p>

        <p>In the process of seeing the information is processed through a visual system which includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the sense organ (eye)</li>
            <li>the receptors-rods and cones</li>
            <li>the whole process of visual pathways which starts from eye to the brain.</li>
        </ul>
        <enable-grey-box><p><strong>A person whose vision is so severely affected to the extent of not being able to see is referred
            to as blind.</strong></p></enable-grey-box>

            about degrees of visual loss, see the section â€œWhat is visual impairmentâ€�.</p>
