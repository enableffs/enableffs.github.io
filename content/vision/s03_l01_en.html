        <p>Visual impairment refers to a significant functional loss of vision. This functional loss varies from low
            visual loss to total vision loss.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A person with low visual functional loss has a possibility to see based on refractive corrections.</li>
            <li>Blindness refers to inability to see at all or to merely perceive light.</li>

        <h3>Causes of visual impairment</h3>

        <p>Visual impairment can be caused by various factors including prenatal, neonatal and postnatal factors.</p>
        <ul><li>Prenatal causes may be consequences of the living style of pregnant mothers which affect the child before birth.</li>
            <li>Neonatal causes may occur during birth especially issues related to
            infections and accidents or trauma.</li>
            <li>Postnatal causes may be environmental factors a person encounters in the surroundings including
                nutrition, accidents, infections or diseases.</li></ul>



        <h4>Some of the causes of visual impairment are as follows:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cataracts</strong> are congenital and pediatric pathology that describes the greying or opacity
                of the crystalline lens

                <enable-read-more label="Read more about cataract">In case of adults, cataracts are associated with aging. As
                    we age we are likely to experience cataract. However, there is a possibility of reducing risk to experience
                    cataract by avoiding smoking and extensive exposure to sunlight.<br><br>

                </enable-read-more>
            </li>


            <li><strong>Retinitis pigmentosa</strong> is a group of genetic disorders that affect the retina's ability
                to respond to light. This inherited disease causes a slow loss of vision.


                <enable-read-more label="Read more about and see an example of retinitis pigmentosa">Retinitis pigmentosa causes permanent changes
                    to your vision, but how much and how quickly can really vary from person to person. These retinal
                    changes can affect your side vision, which makes it harder for you to see in dim light or the dark, and
                    central vision, which causes difficulty with detailed activities such as reading or watching television.<br><br>

            <li><strong>Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)</strong> can occur in a developing fetus of a pregnant woman
                who has contracted rubella. CRS can cause sensorineural deafness (58% of patients) or eye abnormalities
                — especially retinopathy, cataract, and microphthalmia (43% of patients).


            <li><strong>Usher syndrome</strong> is a relatively rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in any one of
                10 genes resulting in a combination of hearing loss and visual impairment, and is a leading cause of
                deafblindness. Usher syndrome is incurable at present.
                <enable-read-more label="Read more about usher syndrome">Usher syndrome is characterized by hearing loss and
                    a gradual visual impairment. The hearing loss is caused by a defective inner ear, whereas the vision
                    loss results from retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

            <li><strong>HIV/AIDS</strong> may cause both visual and hearing impairment.

                    infected with an Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is a life threatening condition. In East Africa region the governments have mounted
                    free services for HIV/AIDS related conditions. In places where services are provided, people rarely face difficulties. Services provided
                    include counselling supplements, and medication.<br> Poverty may affect the general care of people with HIV/AIDS. Deterioration of body immunity
                    may occur, and may have impact on vision. In Kenya for example, there are disability friendly centres for HIV/AIDS and related conditions
                    for persons with disability.</enable-read-more>

            <li><strong>Malaria</strong> can cause brain hemorrhage, although rarely.
                <enable-read-more label="Read more about malaria">Brain hemorrhage is sometimes associated with severe
                    cerebral malaria (caused by infection with Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly form of malaria). This
                    bleeding in the brain could cause blindness—whether the visual impairment is permanent or not depends on
                    the extent of the bleeding and how much damage it caused.

            <li><strong>Corneal opacification</strong> can cause anything from minor irritation to vision problems and

                <enable-read-more label="Read more about corneal opacification">The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped area
                    that covers the front of the eye. Light passes through the cornea before reaching the retina in the back
                    of the eye, and so it must remain clear so light can pass through. Injury, infection, and certain eye
                    diseases can cause corneal opacities.

                <enable-read-more label="Read more about refractory errors">
                    <strong>Myopia</strong> also called ‘nearsightedness’ it is most common refractive error of the eyes. It is a condition in which objects
                    which are close are seen clearly, but objects which are farther away seem to be blurred. This condition
                    can be corrected by eyeglasses, or contact glasses. There has been speculation whether myopia is inherited.
                    Reports show that myopia is not inherited; it is a condition which may be due to excessive reading and
                    doing other close to eyes work. It ranges from mild, moderate to severe conditions.
                    <br>

                    <p><strong>Hyperopia</strong> is also called farsightedness, a common type of refractive error where distant objects may be seen
                        more clearly that objects which are near. Therefore people with hyperopia can see distant objects very well,  but experience
                        problems with objects that are close. Hyperopia is considered to be a common vision problem. It can be corrected by eyeglasses
                        and contact lenses, but it is not possible to cure the situation. It is also reported that surgery may reduce dependency to glasses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Astigmatism</strong> is a common and usually minor condition of the eye that cause blurred or distorted vision. It is a common
                        type of refractive error. The condition in which they eye does not focus light evenly onto the retina. In case of astigmatism, the
                        following may be remedies to the situation: use of corrected eyeglasses, contact lenses and refractive surgery. The signs and symptoms

            <li><strong>Injuries</strong> can cause visual impairment. People who have been involved in accidents often
                need rehabilitation, training in communication and activities of daily living.

                    chemical substance in the body. This condition is inherited and there is no treatment for the condition. The father and mother have has genes
                    that lead to albinism. So the fusion of the two sets of genes is what usually causes a child to be born
                    with albinism. Albinism is not specific to human beings. It happens with animals, birds, plants and every
                    living organism. The colour of the skin does not reflect the nationality or origin of a person with albinism. For human beings,
                    the lack of the necessary pigment can increase the risk for skin cancer.<br>
                    However, it also has an impact on the sight.<br><br> It leads to eyes not being stable and having a frequent movement. This condition is
                    known as nystagmus. It has a consequence of not being able to see
                    properly. There is noe alignment,
                    that is why you can see that a person who wants to look to an object may turn the head sideways, and maybe just one of the
                    two eyes are stronger than the other so they have to look with that one eye. That is why it is very difficult for them
                    to be
                    focused when they look at an object.<br> When a child is born with albinism, the eyes are much stronger, but with age
                    this power
                    size decreases and it becomes weaker when exposed to the sun. People with albinism have to change their spectacles
                    more often
                    than people without. The power which remains may finally disappear completely so in the end they will not be able to see.<br>
                    Persons with albinism should be protected from the sun by wearing hats and sun glasses to avoid the adverse effects of the sun’s rays on their
                    skins and eyes respectively. Application of the sun-screen lotions on the skin is recommended for skin protection. Furthermore, dressing should
                    cover most of the body parts as well to protect them from the sun’s effects, on the skin.<br>
                    In the recent past, the lives of persons with albinism in East Africa have been at risk due to myths and beliefs associated with witchcraft.
                    Consequently, there is a need for sensitization of communities about albinism as a condition which does not make a person different from other
                    persons except for lack of skin pigmentation.
