        <p>Fimbo nyeupe ni kisaidizi kikubwa katika kutembea huku na kule kwa ajili ya watu wenye ulemavu wa kuona. Watu wengi wenye
		ulemavu wa macho hutumia fimbo nyeupe ikiwa ni zana inayosaidia kutembelea sehemu mbalimbali.</p>

    <enable-grey-box e-type="funfact"><p>Mtu wa kwanza aliyetumia fimbo nyeupe alikuwa anaitwa James Biggs. Alikuwa mpigapicha wa Kiingereza
	aliyepata ulemavu wa kuona baada ya ajali. Ili aweze kuonekana zaidi alipakaa rangi nyeupe fimbo yake ya kutembelea.</p> </enable-grey-box>

        <enable-read-more label="Audio description"><p>Moses, who is a blind student at Kyambogo University, sits in a resource room
            and tells how he learned to move around on campus using a white cane.<br><br> He says: I’ve got a guide. The university employs a guide for you. So, this guide started moving me around this
            university. So, I started to capture the places, I knew this was the resource room. But my first place to capture
            was the dining hall actually. Because it is very important to always have meals. So, when I wanted to go to the
            dining hall, the library or the lecture rooms, the guide could show it to me. They showed me all the places I needed
            to go, and I slowly started to capture you know, when you stay in a place for a long time you get a mental picture.
            And also by the course that I did have in mobility. So, it gave me a lot of knowledge.<br><br> Moses leave the resource
            room and let the white cane explore the surface in front him. He continues moving fast on an outdoor corridor. He seems
            to know exactly where to go.<br><br> He says: So, I started to move alone. I was like…no, I don't want to move with a
            guide. I want to try moving alone. So, I started to move alone. Taking myself to lectures. Taking myself to the shop.
            Moses turn to the left when he recognizes a corner with his cane.<br><br> He says: Taking myself to the dining hall
            and all other places of importance.<br><br> He continues walking and reaches some stairs. A new corner is in front
            of him and Moses turns right on his way towards a shop.<br><br> He reaches the shop and says: Hello. Can I have a soda?
            <br><br> A saleswoman gives Moses a soda.<br><br> When receiving the bottle Moses says: Thank you.<br><br> Afterwards Moses
            follow the same route back to the resource room.</p></enable-read-more>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="warning"><p>Tofauti ya rangi ina maana katika baadhi ya nchi. Kwa mfano fimbo nyeupe huonyesha kwamba mtu
		ni mlemavu wa kuona wakati fimbo ya kijani hutambulisha kwamba mtu ana uoni hafifu au uharibifu wa uwezo wa kuona ni wa kiwango kidogo.</p></enable-grey-box>

        <h4>Waongozaji wa njia</h4>
        <p>Baadhi ya watu huwatumia mbwa maalum mwenye kuelekeza njia badala ya fimbo nyeupe. Mbwa wanaoelekeza njia wamepata mafunzo
		na wanaweza kuongoza njia kupita kwenye vikwazo mbalimbali. Hatahivyo changamoto ni kwamba mbwa mwongoza njia hawezi kufafanua
		alama zilizoko mitaani, ikiwa ni pamoja na taa zinazoongoza magari. Zaidi ya hayo, mbwa waongozao
		watu wanakatazwa kwa baadhi ya mashirika ya dini. Kwahiyo, inaonekana kuwa vigumu kwa watu wenye ulemavu wa kuona kusaidiwa na mbwa.</p>

        <p>Katika mazingira ya Kiafrika matumizi ya mbwa mwongoza njia ni madogo, na pia haichukuliwi kwa mtazamo chanya. Watu
		wanafarijika zaidi wanaposaidiwa na marafiki zao na ndugu zao kwa sababu za kijamii.</p>

        <enable-read-more label="Transcribed interview"><p>On the issue of the human rights, unfortunately most blind people use human
            guides as I said. Many of us use our wives, maybe blind women also use their husbands, sighted husbands. Where there are no
            sighted husbands, where there are no sighted wives, we use our sighted children. I have children who are sighted. So now
            when I want to go to market, that day the child will not go to school. That child has to stay at home to guide me to the
            market. May be to hospital, maybe to town, maybe for a meeting. So eventually this child starts performing very badly at
            school because I used him every day to accompany me somewhere.<br>
            Secondly, we are mature people, we are big man, we are big women we use our children even during privacy. For example,
            I want to go to a toilet, my sighted child is going to guide me to a toilet where I could go alone using my white cane
            or using a guide dog if we were using guide dogs. Instead of the child accompanying me to the toilet. For example, I want
            to to be friend prossy? As a girl as a lady. I use my own child for a social evening. I want to go to a bar, I want to go
            to some social life, I want to go for a dance. I go with a child! And eventually, the child learns behavior which are not
            good for children. It is child abuse, in other words. That is child abuse. But worst of all, the child’s rights are
            completely deprived. When the child is supposed to go to play, you are taking him to a bar to accompany you. When the
            child is supposed to go and read his books, you are taking the child for a dance. You know. So, there are so many i
            nconveniences in depending on children guides.
