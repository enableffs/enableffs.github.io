        <p>Sexuality is one of the sensitive topics especially in African context. Students with visual impairment
            need to
            know about their sexuality.</p>  <p>It is important to orient them to biological changes especially during the
            adolescence period. The effect of not providing knowledge about sexuality to people with visual impairment
        may lead to more serious problems, for example, teenage pregnancy and low self-esteem.</p><p>Also important knowledge about <strong>hygiene</strong>,
            <strong>self-awareness</strong>, <strong>sexual rights</strong> and <strong>abuse</strong> need to be
        discussed with them. Persons with visual impairment need to be encouraged to be confident of themselves
        and have a positive portrayal of themselves.</p>
