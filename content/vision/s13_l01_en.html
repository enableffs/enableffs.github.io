        <p>Learning experience shows that people frequently ask questions about visual impairment. Some of these
            questions intend to find out how to assist people with visual impairment as well as gain knowledge about the
            whole concept of visual impairment.</p> <p><strong>Parents</strong> may also have questions about how to go about the situation of
            having a child with visual impairment.</p><p><strong>Teachers and  learners</strong> in schools may also frequently
            ask themselves several questions about visual impairment.</p>
            <enable-grey-box >Remember the questions asked frequently intend
            to generate information which will make the community helpful to people with visual impairment.</enable-grey-box>
            <p> Therefore it is important to highlight some questions which are frequently asked and find how diverse and helpful
            responses may be.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Is visual impairment inherited?</strong><br>This question has both yes and no answers. Some
                conditions which cause visual impairment are from hereditary factors such as usher syndrome and sickle retinopathy.
                Both usher’s syndrome and sickle cell anaemia are carried on recessive genes and transmitted from parent to offspring.
                Some other conditions are not hereditary. They are caused by disease infections, chemical injuries, physical trauma to
                mention a few.</li>
            <li><strong>As vision fails, do the other senses become stronger?</strong><br>As you may be aware, the visual sense contributes
                more than 80% of the information from the environment. However, when vision is defective, the individual’s other senses are
                adapted to collect as much information as possible from the environment. So the individual largely depends on these other senses
                for information gathering.</li>
            <li><strong>Should I give my  learners with visual impairment similar tasks to their colleagues who are not visually
                impaired?</strong>
            <br>It is good practice to expose your  learners to similar educational experiences such as
                common curriculum content. This is in line with the inclusive education practices, which are currently a popular
                approach to education. However, should provide adaptations which compensate for visual loss. These adaptations may be
                in the curriculum content, pedagogical methods, extension of time and adjustment of the learning environment in
                general.</li>
            <li><strong>How do people who are blind get around safely?</strong><br>People who are blind require some
                training in orientation and mobility skills. These skills enable them to locate their position and also the
                direction of where they wish to go in the environment. They may use human guides, guide dogs or mobility devices such
                as the white cane.</li>
            <li><strong>Can visually impaired  learners choose any career?</strong><br>Yes. It depends on the support
                provided to the  learners with visual impairment. This support must come from the parents or caregivers, teachers and
                community members. The  learners need to be motivated in the careers of their choice. Careers for  learners with visual
                impairment range from scientists, economists, teachers, lawyers, social workers, entertainers and therapists to
                mention a few.</li>
            <li><strong>Should I assign my child who is visually impaired family chores?</strong><br>Yes. This child is
                like any other child and should be included in almost all family activities depending on the nature of the task.
                Tasks which are visually demanding might be challenging to the child. Also if given support, they can be able
                to perform the tasks assigned to them.</li>
            <li><strong>Can a person with visual impairment communicate using a mobile phone?</strong><br>Yes. A person with visual impairment can
                enjoy and benefit from varieties of the current technologies within the community. Mobile phones have accessibility options
                such as audio, bright colours and large fonts, which can be conveniently used by persons with visual impairment. Some types of
                mobile phones have large buttons and associated large fonts for persons with limited vision. </li>
            <li><strong>How should I speak to someone who is blind?</strong><br>You should address him or her just like you
                do to any other person. Do not hesitate to use common vocabulary such as mentioning colours and expressions as if the
                person with visual impairment is seeing you.</li>
            <li><strong>How do people with visual impairment  distinguish between different denominations of money?</strong><br>It is
                easy for them to distinguish coins from bank notes. Coins usually have different sizes and it is easy to identify the various
                denominations among them. Some currencies have provided certain marks at the corners of the notes purposely for persons who are
                blind to explore tactually. Some persons with visual impairment device their own methods for identifying the various notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Is it socially accepted to use guide dogs in the extended communities?</strong><br>Yes. Depending on which part of the world you
                are situated in. For countries in the north, it is culturally permissible to use guide dogs for mobility within the community.
                In the East African region, few people are aware of guide dogs and even if they are, the cultural and religious beliefs may
                bar them from using them as mobility aids.</li>
