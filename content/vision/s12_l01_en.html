        <p>People with visual impairment have ability to make their career choices. What is important is the support

        <enable-read-more label="Read the transcribed interview"><p>It is our recognition that quite a number of people
            are loosing
            sight out there later in life. And many of them have to drop out of their employment because they are not
            able to cope
            with the challenges and maybe also be under study by their employers. They seem to believe that once you
            have lost your
            sight you become to a disability into the company or organisation and any many of them have taken an early
            retirement.
            We recognize that the new constitution requires that every institution or organisation should employ at
            least five
            percent. Five percent of the employees should be those with disabilities. We are recognizing then that we
            need to
            equip the persons with disabilities who are our colleges with skills that will make them become as useful as
            they
            have been even if they have been to a lower degree than those in the organisation who are employed. So we
            have started
            advertising ourselves, we have started going around to identify those people who are loosing sight and maybe
            hanging
            out. They do no know what to do. We bring them back; equip them with necessary skills so they can resume
            their
            employment at least.<br>We know we cannot achieve 100 %. It is our duty is to enable the affected
            individuals,
            the employers, at least persons who have some limitations. We are able to perform this way and that is the
            degree.
            We know, a driver may not go back to driving but they can still be utilized, we need them employed in the
            institution,
            doing some other kind of work. But we start to move towards the ghetto, and there is a lot to do in the
            field of
            modern technology, so our concern is to equip all persons with visually impairment particularly with adapted
            technology skills. We know others have trained them before from diverse institutions, do not have the
            computer
            skills. They remain to employ some readers, but we know if they equipped with those skills, access
            information,
            at least much of the information they are required to work with through the computer.</p>

        <h4>The blind tailor</h4>

        <p>Abdallah Nyangalio (Dr) is a blind tailor who had his eyes removed because of
            Trachoma.
            After the operation, he learned how to sew. He even taught his own and the neighbours kids how to make
            suits.
            After making a really nice suit for an arrangement he got famous and wanted to share his knowledge with
            others
            to prevent them from poverty and begging for money. He got in touch with Tanzania Trade Development
            Authority
            (TanTrade) and from them he received three sewing machines. He expanded his business and even employed
            six
            trainees.

                which is a product of the training. I’m very happy and I hope in the future I can become like Dr.

            <p>My name is Zainab Mbuguni. I live in Kinondoni, D´salaam. My education is on the primary level. I did not
                pass my exams, so I learned to become a tailor. I started facing eye problems after I suffered from
                headache. That was in 1991. I went to the hospital in 1992, and they told me that I had to undergo
                surgery. In 1992 I had to remove one of my eyes. In 1994 I had to have another surgery, and the doctor
                that preformed my surgery said that I would only be able to see.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1995 I lost the ability to see. So, in 1995 I lost sight completely. I was sad and sorrowful, and I
                did not know what to do. But the doctor told me to go to an association for blind people, and that there
                were people who could tell me what to do there. In 1998 I joined the association who took me to an
                institution where I was thought to do different things. Since 1998-2000 I was at this institution where
                I was thought to do different things, including farming. I did not think I could to any kind of work, it
                was a bit stranger for me. But I knew basketry, because my mother thought me that before I got blind.
                <br>
                <br>
                For some time, I did not know what to do. But when I joined the association, and when I got involved in
                basketry, I opened a kiosk where I sell different kind of items. Now I work hand in hand with this
                association. Later on, I thought that this kiosk did not pay enough. Because of the location it did not
                go well. I started selling water and other things, and then I moved to this new area. This is now my
                main duty, but there are a few challenges. The main one is the marked to sell my products. So, if I hear
                something from others I go there to sell my things.
                <br><br>
                <strong>How is this business, can you survive of this? </strong>
                <br>
                Yes, I live on this business, but it’s not easy. Sometimes I get very tired, it causes chest pain, and I
                don’t feel ok. Then I rest for a while and I come back later.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Have you got much support from family, the community or an organization? </strong>
                <br>
                Yes, my family has not left me alone, but they are not rich so they support me as best as they can. One
                in my family worked for the association, and told me about it. I have even seen that people that are
                blind that go to school sometimes perform better than people that are not. This was encouraging. I never
                despair, I just keep on struggling. This is something that you can’t do today and you get someone to buy
                your product tomorrow. You have to wait. But this is not the only thing I do, I do some other jobs as
                well.
                <br><br>
                <strong>What would you tell other blind people to do to get a meaningful job and a meaningful life? </strong>
                <br>
                I have met several people with visual impairment, I tell them not to despair, and to keep on moving. Not
                stay in one place waiting. I tell them to use their other senses, and use their words. They should
                rather get moving and try to make their own living, than to wait for others to help them.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Do you get any help for the government? </strong>
                <br>
                What kind of help?
                <br>
                Financial.
                <br>
                There is no money from the government for blind people.
                <br><br>
                <strong>She mentioned other business. What are they? </strong>
                <br>
                I sell water to the community. This is an important business for me.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Was she given a diagnose? What did they call the disease? </strong>
                <br>
                It was just a headache.
                <br><br>
                <strong>If you get hurt or something, and not able to work. What is your opportunity? </strong>
                <br>
                I don’t know how I would survive. That depends on what God decides for me. But I pray that I don’t have
                any more problems. It would be very difficult for me.
                <br><br>
                <strong>What difficulties have you met on the way?  </strong>
                <br>
                The place where I live. It is only reachable if it not rains. If it’s raining, the soil get wet and
                slippery and I cannot go here. I have to ask people if it’s raining or not. If it has rained when I was
                here, I cannot get home. Then I have to go to my relatives. I have to get someone to drive me with a
                motorbike. If it rains when I’m home, I can’t get to work. If it rains when I’m at work I can’t get
                home.
                <br><br>
                There are many challenges for people with different kind of disabilities meet. For example, with public
                transport. Sometimes they refuse us to get on the bus. Some people feel with you, but others they
                stigmatize this group. But you just have to struggle to be able to live. You for example have to push
                yourself on the bus. Because you have to pay rant. No one will say that you won’t pay rent since you are
                blind. Someone won’t even rent to blind people, because they think you cannot pay. So, they say go away.
                If we had the opportunity, it would be better to work from home so we did not have to move around.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Do you get any support to help you sell your products? </strong>
                <br>
                Well sometimes there are workshops for people with different kind of disabilities. And on this day, we
                meet, and we show what we have to sell. We have different abilities. But it depends on if the
                association have money for you or not.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Do you have the name of the organization? </strong>
                <br>
                Tanzania league of the blind has members in terms of associations. This is the regional association.
