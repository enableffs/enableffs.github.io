        <p>Recreation and leisure activities are important for people’s health, social, and psychological well-being, regardless
            of one’s disability. Some activities may require physical energy such as athletics and some, mental energy such as
            scrabble or cards. <br>From early age, children with visual impairment should be encouraged to engage in playing games
            as it promotes learning. Through participation in games during leisure, the social and communication skills are
            further developed for a person with visual impairment.<br> Depending on the individual preferences, persons with
            visual impairment may choose to engage in group or solitary game activities or active versus passive leisure
            activities such as reading a novel.<br><br>
            The activities may vary from simple to complex, cheap to expensive, indoor to outdoor and individual to group.</p>

        <enable-grey-box><p><strong>Henry Wanyoike</strong> is a famous blind Paralympics runner contestant from Kenya. The successful
            story of Wanyoike is a lesson to many people who perceive disability as inability. Wanyoike’s
            story contributes to attitude change that given the opportunity, a non-sighted person can do what
            a sighted person can. Wanyoike was born sighted; however after suffering a stroke he asserts
            that he <strong>“lost his sight but not his vision”</strong>.
            <p>The new situation was difficult to him, but later on he
                surprised the world by successfully participating in Paralympics and bagging several awards. <br>Read more about <enable-link href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/the-visionary-henry-wanyoike">Henry Wanyoike</enable-link>.</p>
