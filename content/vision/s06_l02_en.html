        <enable-grey-box e-type="funfact">Louis Braille (1809-1852) lost his sight in an accident when he was three
            years old. In 1821, at the age of sixteen, he invented a system of reading and writing for use by
            persons who are blind or visually impaired. The system in known as <strong>Braille</strong>.
        </enable-grey-box>

        <p>At that time, persons who were blind read elevated Latin letters. These letters took time to read and it was
            complicated to produce such a text. Today braille remains known worldwide. Braille is written in different
            languages in the world including English, French, Kiswahili, Hindi amongst others. Braille codes have been
            developed in mathematics, music, science and computer paving way for learners with visual impairment to
            access education to the highest levels.</p>

                cell, two points in the width and the three points in the height. From above the points in the left row is numbered 1-2-3 and the right row 4-5-6.</p></div>
        </div>
        <p>The top four points, 1-2-4-5, create the letters between <strong>a</strong> and <strong>j</strong>.</p>

            <h5>Numbers</h5>

            <p>The symbols for the numbers <strong>1</strong> to <strong>9</strong> are similar to the symbols for the
                letters <strong>a</strong> to <strong>i</strong> except from a prefix.</p>

            <p>The prefix symbol, "number follow", is added in front of the number. A capital letter is created with the

            <h5>Contractions</h5>

            <p>For making communication more effective and less timeconsuming, Braille is divided in different
                contractions, which means that the most common words and combination of letters are represented as
                specialized abbreviations.</p>

            <p>The contractions are defined in different levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grade one Braille with no contractions. Uncontracted braille comprises the alphabet, numbers,
                    punctuation and some composition symbols. All words are spelled out in full, with no shorterned
                    versions.
                </li>
                <li>Grade one and a half Braille with about 50 contractions</li>
                <li>Grade two Braille, uses a number of “contractions” which are basically used to make words shorter.
                    There are 189 contractions in total. Most literature that is embossed in braille is written in
                    contracted Braille.
                </li>
                <li>Grade three Braille have many hundreds of contractions</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>What Braille is used for?</h4>

        <p> With braille it is possible to convert different materials into a format that can be accessible by people
            with visual impairment. Students can also use Braille to prepare their work and print in a format
            that is accessible to sighted teachers. Therefore Braille can accommodate the needs of visually impaired
            students.</p>

        <p>If affordable it is possible to get Braille textbooks, paperless Braille e-books and writing devices.</p>

        <p>Embossed Braille takes up more space than print, so producing a shorthand version of Braille helps make
            Braille literature less bulky.</p>
