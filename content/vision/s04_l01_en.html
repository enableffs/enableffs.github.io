        <p>One can identify a person with visual impairment through the following aspects:</p>
        <ul><li>Complaints</li>
        <li>Appearance of the eye(s)</li>
        <li>Physical behaviours</li>
        <li>Screening</li></ul>
        <h4>Complaints</h4>
        <p>The person with visual impairment may have repeated complaints like eye scratching, burning, and itchy skin. Further
            complaints can be about seeing blurred images or objects being in double images.</p>
        <h4>Appearance of the eye(s)</h4>
        <p>The appearance of the eye may also indicate something is wrong with the eye. For example, the
            eyes maybe watery or seemingly inflamed, swollen or even appearing crossed. In addition the eyelids may not completely cover the eyes when closed.
            If you notice these indicators, it is important to consult the eye
            practitioners for examinations. </p>

            <h4>Physical behaviours</h4>

                <p>It is possible for a person with visual impairment to exhibit the following behaviours,
                    among others:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tendency to feel objects with their hands instead of looking at them.</li>
                    <li>Rubbing eyes excessively.</li>
                    <li>Turning or tilting  the head when using eyes to see or focus on an object.</li>
                    <li>Difficulty with activities which demand use of eyes.</li>
                    <li>Difficulty in reading (to one who knows to read).</li>
                    <li>Hold books too close to eyes when reading.</li>
                    <li>When watching television, may tend to be very close to it.</li>
                    <li>May show excessive blinking.</li>
                    <li>When looking at things, may hold them in a particular position.</li>
                    <li>In the classroom, may be constantly asking mates about what is going on around.</li>
                    <li>Tend to hold objects very close or very far to see them.</li>
                    <li>Tend to bump into objects and having trouble seeing at night.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Screening</h3>
            <p>The most important way of getting to know whether a person has a vision problem is through <strong>screening</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>This refers to a method of identifying children with visual impairment or eye conditions that are likely
                to lead to visual impairment. The aim of screening is to identify the visual problem. Both children and
                adults can undergo vision screening.</p>
            <p>Through screening, the following categories of problems may be identified:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Neonatal conditions</li>
                <li>Risk factors</li>
                <li>Refractive errors</li>
                <li>Colour vision abnormalities</li>
            </ul>

                .
            </p>


            <h3>Early intervention</h3>
            <p>Early intervention can mean both interventions in early years of human life or intervention in early
                stages of visual loss. If a parent, caretaker or teacher notices any anomalies or difficulties in a
                childâ€™s vision, he/she should consult an eye doctor or othe vision specialist for assistance.</p>
            <enable-grey-box e-type="quote">Early intervention is extremely important. The reason is: if it is in
                children then it is likely possible to prepare interventions which may help the child.
            </enable-grey-box>

            <p>If the child is at school, special programs will be effective for child development in all domains:
                intellectual, physical, social and emotional. Teachers can refer the child with a visual problem for further support.
                 In the case of Kenya, the children can be referred to Education Assessment Resource Centres (EARCs) for
                vision assessment.  </p>

            <p>In case the early intervention is to an adult who has just started developing signs of visual impairment,
                there is a possibility to handle the situation.</p>
