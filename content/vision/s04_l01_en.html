        <p>It is likely to identify a person and students with visual impairment through the following aspects:</p>

            <h3>Complaints</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The person with visual impairment may have reported complaints like eye scratchy, burning, and itchy.
                    Further complains can be about seeing blur or objects being in double images.</p>

            <h3>Appearance of the eye(s)</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The appearance of the eye may also indicate something is wrong with the eye. For example when you
                    find oneâ€™s
                    eyes are watery or seemed inflamed, swollen or even appeared crossed. It is important to consult the
                    eye
                    practitioners for examinations.</p>

            <h3>Physical behaviours</h3>
            <div>
                <p>It is likely possible for a person with visual impairment to behave excessively among the following
                    behaviours:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tend to feel objects with their hands instead of looking at them.</li>
                    <li>Rubbing eyes excessively.</li>
                    <li>Turning or tilting his head when uses eyes to see or focus on an object.</li>
                    <li>Tend to have difficulty to activities demand use of eyes.</li>
                    <li>Eyelids which do not completely cover the eyes when closed.</li>
                    <li>May show difficulty in reading (to one who knows to read).</li>
                    <li>When reading tend to hold books too close to eyes.</li>
                    <li>When watching television, may tend to be very close to the television.</li>
                    <li>May show blinks more than usual (but how much is usual).</li>
                    <li>When looking at things may hold them in a particular position.</li>
                    <li>In classroom may be constantly asking mates about what is going on around.</li>
                    <li>Tend to hold objects very close or very far to see them.</li>
                    <li>Tend to bump into objects and having trouble to see at night.</li>

            <h3>Screening</h3>
            <p>The most important way of getting to know whether a person has vision problem is through <strong>screening</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>This refers to a method of identifying children with visual impairment or eye conditions that are likely
                to lead to visual impairment. The aim of screening is to identify the visual problem. Both children and
                adults can undergo vision screening.</p>
            <p>Through screening the following may be categories of problems to be identified:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>neonatal conditions</li>
                <li>risk factors</li>
                <li>refractive errors</li>
                <li>colour vision abnormalities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Early intervention</h3>
            <p>Early intervention can mean both interventions in early years of human life or intervention in early
                stages of visual loss.</p>
            <enable-grey-box e-type="quote">Early intervention is extremely important. The reason is: if it is in
                children then it is likely possible to prepare interventions which may help the child.
            </enable-grey-box>

            <p>If the child is at school, special programs will be effective for child development in all domains
                intellectual, physical, social and emotional.</p>

            <p>In case the early intervention is to an adult who has just started developing signs of visual impairment,
                there is a possibility to handle the situation.</p>
