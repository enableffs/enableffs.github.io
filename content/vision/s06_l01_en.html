      <h4>Assistive technology</h4>

      <p>Assistive technology refers to equipment or information technology which enables materials to be accessible
          to different types of users including people with visual impairment. The intention of assistive technology is
          to accommodate the needs of the individuals with vision loss.</p>
        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Communication is about exchange of information</enable-quotebox>

        <br>

        <p>It is occurs through the use of sensory organs including the eyes. In case of visual impairment, where a
            person cannot solidly depend on eyes,  assistive  devices can be used to support exchange of
            information.</p>
        <h4>Examples of assistive devices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>optic glasses/spectacles</li>
            <li>magnifiers</li>
            <li>electronic gloves</li>
            <li>braille machine/slate</li>
            <li>tactile graphics</li>
            <li>auditory formatted materials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to select means of communication that is relevant to an individual
            depending on his or her needs. Some persons with visual impairment need only glasses and access the
            world as usual. It is important to identify the needs of the  learners or persons with visual impairment.
            Persons with disability may need special means; therefore teachers need to pay attention to what is working
            to a specific person instead of generalizing.</p>
