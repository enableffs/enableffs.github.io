        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">Communication is about exchange of information.</enable-quotebox>

        <br>

        <p>It is done through the use of sensory organs including the eyes. In case of visual impairment, where a
            person cannot solidly depend on eyes,  assistive technology  devices can be used to support exchange of
            information.</p>
        <h4>Examples of devices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>optic glasses/spectacles</li>
            <li>magnifiers</li>
            <li>electronic gloves</li>
            <li>braille machine/slate</li>
            <li>tactile graphics</li>
            <li>auditory formatted materials</li>
            <li>more devices (electronic, digital)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to select means of communication that is relevant to an individual
            depending on the individual needs. Some persons with visual impairment need only glasses and access the
            world as usual. It is important to identify the needs of the students or persons with visual impairment.
            Persons with disability may need special means; therefore teachers need to pay attention to what is working
            to a specific person instead of generalizing.</p>

        <enable-read-more label="Audio description"><p>A male teacher is standing in front of a blackboard in an inclusive class with both sighted and visually impaired students. He is showing two
            feathers from a hen to the secondary class students. He says:<br>
            They are at different looking.<br><br>
            A blind student touches a feather carefully with his fingers. Another student comes with a hen and gives it to the teacher.<br><br>
            The teacher says:<br>
            So, thank you very much. This is aâ€¦what name is given to this one?<br><br>
            Some students answer:<br>
            A hen.<br><br>
            The teacher continues:<br>
            A hen, very good. So, if this is a hen, what is this?<br><br>
            Some students answer: Mouth!<br>
            Other students says: Beak!<br><br>
            The teacher brings the hen in front of a blind student and asks him:<br>
            Kasamba, what is this?<br><br>
            The teacher brings the students fingers to the hen and repeats:<br>
            What is that?<br><br>
            Kasamba answers:<br>
            Beak.<br><br>
            The teacher continues:<br>
            And there?<br><br>
            Kasamba says:<br>
            That's the head.<br><br>
            The teacher continues asking:<br>
            It also has a neck. Then what about this?<br><br>
            Kasamba answers again:<br>
            Wings.<br><br>
            The teacher:<br>
            Can you continue? What is that?<br><br>
            Kasamba once more try to touch the hen before he answers.<br>
            Wings.<br><br>
            The teacher asks the class:<br>
            What is this class?<br><br>
            The students answer:<br>
            Wings.<br><br>
            The teacher asks another blind student at the first row:<br>
            What is this?<br><br>
            He answers:<br>
            Tail.<br><br>
            The dialogue between them continues:
            And what about down there?<br>
            Legs.<br>
            What is on here?<br><br>
            The answer is not heard. Instead we hear the voice of the teacher off-screen:<br>
            It is important to look at real things to learn. To look at it in the real format.<br><br>
            The teacher says on-screen:<br>
            I look at that in that format. If you teach without concrete materials the children turn passive in the learning.<br><br>
            A boy investigates two feathers. Another boy does the same.<br>
            So I expect, I hope that when I bring concrete materials they get the exact wisdom.<br><br>
            A boy is writing on a slate while another boy writes on a Perkins braillewriter.

        <h4>Assistive technology</h4>

        <p>Assistive technology refers to equipment or information technology which enables materials to be accessible
            to different types of users including people with visual impairment. The intention of assistive technology is
            to accommodate the needs of the individuals with vision loss.</p>
