        <p>It is done through the use of sensory organs including the eyes. In case of visual impairment, where a
            person cannot solidly depend on eyes,  assistive technology  devices can be used to support exchange of
            information.</p>
        <h4>Examples of devices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>optic glasses/spectacles</li>
            <li>magnifiers</li>
            <li>electronic gloves</li>
            <li>braille machine/slate</li>
            <li>tactile graphics</li>
            <li>auditory formatted materials</li>
            <li>more devices (electronic, digital)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to select means of communication that is relevant to an individual
            depending on the individual needs. Some persons with visual impairment need only glasses and access the
            world as usual. It is important to identify the needs of the students or persons with visual impairment.
            Persons with disability may need special means; therefore teachers need to pay attention to what is working
            to a specific person instead of generalizing.</p>
