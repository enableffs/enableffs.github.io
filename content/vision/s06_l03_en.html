            <p>The first thing I introduce them to and which is very much individualized is the keyboard, because that gets us to
                everything. Everything that a person with visual impairment has to do it has to be done through the keyboard. Maybe
                I didn´t mention that they don´t use the monitor, they also don´t use the mouse, simply because the monitor need
                some visuals so that a learner would be able to check what is displayed. At same way the mouse require some vision
                too, so a learner is able to follow the cursors movements on the screen. But then my learners are not able to see,
                so they don´t have that vision. That is why we even put the monitor off and we don´t use the mouse.<br> But with the
                keyboard we can´t introduce them too fast, so once they have monitored all the keys on the keyboard, they will in
                a weeks time or two, it takes a lot of time there, because that is the very key.<br> Once they are through with that
                now we introduce them to the other parts of the computer and then we get to know more about introduction to
                computers.<br> Then after that I take them the third package, which is introduction to adaptive technology so that
                they are able to understand and appreciate that. They don´t have the vision and they remain to rely on their
                hearing so that they are able to operate the computer normally, just like any other sighted person.<br> Then after
                that the other packages follow like an introduction to Word, because now after they have known how to use the
                keyboard properly, they are been also introduced to the concept of information and communication technology and
                starting up the machine including including the wiring, I get them to touch where the wires are. I get them to
                understand the connection so that the computer is powered on. Right from the socket where the xxx (?) is to the
                purpose of all that and all the connections.</p>

        <h3>Screen readers on PCs and laptops.</h3>
        <p>Through advancement of technology, computers with certain software are now doing different activities that can be useful to people with
        visual impairment. A screen reader is a software application that attempts to identify and interpret what
        is being displayed on the screen. This interpretation is then re-presented to the user with text-to-speech, sound icons, or a Braille output device
        (Source: Wikipedia). Jaws is a widely used screen reader but it is a rather expensive tool. Laptops from Apple have a built-in function in their operative systems
        called "VoiceOver". Even if Apple-products are rather expensive to purchase, the built-in screen reader are free and maybe less expensive than a Windows-computer
        with Jaws.</p>

<h3>Embedded voice and screen readers on smartphones and tablets</h3>
<p>During the recent years smartphones and tablets have taken over much of the functionality earlier associated with the use of PCs.</p>
    <ul><li>Ipad and Iphone have “VoiceOver” too and the program can in many contexts replace Jaws.</li>
    <li>    Smartphones with the operating system Android have the embedded screen reader "TalkBack". Be aware of that the quality of “Talkback” differs in the different apps.</li></ul>

        <enable-read-more label="How to activate “VoiceOver” and “Talkback” ">
        <ol><li>Go to "Settings"</li>
            <li>Select "Availability"</li>
            <li>Select " VoiceOver"/"Talkback"</li>
            <li>Turn on "VoiceOver"/"Talkback". (On Android 4.0 you must go back and activate the touch exploration too)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Increase the font size and the contrast</h3>
        <p>Both iPhone and iPad and several Android phones have the built in ability to enlarge what you see on the screen, to increase the font size or increase the contrast.</p>

        <h3>Tixels replacing pixels</h3>
        <p>The Austrian company <enable-link href="http://blitab.com/">“Blitap”</enable-link> has developed a tablet which replaces the traditional touch-screen with a tactile display.
            Instead of visual pixels small physical bubbles (tixels) are raising from the screen. The screen has the capacity of 14 lines with braille and it can even display
            graphical content.<br> <br>The tablet is divided into two parts where text and images are displayed as graphic
            representation on the lower touch-screen and as similar tactile representation on the upper screen. <br><br> A text to speech program allow the user to navigate
            on the ordinary touch-screen. Webpages as well as textfiles and PDF´s from USB memory sticks or SD-cards can be displayed on the tactile screen.<br><br>The “Blitap” was presented at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in
            January 2017. It is estimated to be available in the stores later this year and the price is expected to be around 2800 $.</p>
