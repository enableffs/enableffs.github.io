        <p>People with visual impairment may need strategies to know where they are and where they want to go.
        Different strategies may help them to walk safely so <strong>orientation</strong> and <strong>mobility</strong> are important.</p>


        <h3>Orientation</h3>
        <p>Orientation refers to the knowledge, skills and ability of a person with visual impairment to be
        able to know where he is or where he wants to go. Most people with visual impairment can do that by using their
        remaining senses.</p>

                <li>Turn ninety degrees towards the square and move over the square to the other end.</li>
                <li>Turn ninety degrees again and move towards the corner.</li>
                <li>Turn ninety degrees once more and move towards the starting point.</li>
                <li>Turn ninety degrees and move a quarter of the whole length.</li>
                <li>Turn ninety degrees towards the square and move half way of the distance to the other side.</li>
                <li>Then turn ninety degrees again and move to the wall/edge.</li>

        <h3>Mobility</h3>
        <p>Mobility refers to the ability of moving through the environment in a safe and easy way.
            Mobility devices like a long white cane, dog guides and other electronic travel aids may support the movement.</p>

        school buildings. The children move like a chain, holding each other’s hands. After them new groups of  learners are following, 12
         learners in total. Most of them are in school uniforms. The kids are talking.<br> Off-screen we hear the voice of
        the headteacher at the school, Francis Kinubi, says:]</i> "The way we are handling the issue of children moving around is… I
        think we are still doing it a bit unprofessionally."<br> <i>[A single blind girl is walking along a path without a white cane.<br>
        Francis Kinubi continues off-screen by saying:]</i> The children just learn moving around independently by themselves. Not as the
        mobility training is supposed to do.<br> <i>Francis Kinubi on-screen says:</i> Because they have just learned the compound by their
        memory. They know the landmarks; they know the trees here. <br> <i>A boy is walking with a plate and a cup in his hands. He is entering a house
        without problems.<br> Francis Kinubi off-screen says:</i> They know were stairs, doors, entrances of the houses are.<br> <i>Several
        children move around in the compound and help each other when Francis Kinubi says:</i> And were the classrooms are. So, they really
        learn the movement around independently on their own, without any serious training.<br><i> Francis Kinubi on-screen says:</i> So,
        if I were to recommend we really need a mobility trainer, first and foremost which we don’t have here. We need an
        orientation expert, because that is also very important.<br> <i>A girl is turning around, almost dancing, when she walks along

       <h3>The importance of assistance</h3>
 <p>The white cane is one of the most important devices for the mobility of persons with visual impairment.
     Sometimes, especially in  the East African region,  these devices may not be easily accessible.
     Therefore, you will find people being guided by others, who are commonly referred to as sighted guides.
      It is also possible to make a long white cane from the locally
     available materials around. In schools, children with visual impairment ma
     y have a friend who assists them.</p>
