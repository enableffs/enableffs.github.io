        <p>A white cane is a major mobility aid for people with visual impairment.
        Many people with visual impairment use it as a mobility tool.</p>

    <enable-grey-box e-type="funfact"><p>The first person that used a white cane was James Biggs.
    He was a British photographer who became blind after an accident. To be more visible, he painted his walking stick white.</p> </enable-grey-box>

            and tells how he learned to move around on campus using a white cane.<br><br> He says:</i> "I’ve got a guide.
            The university employs a guide for me. So, this guide started moving me around this
            university. So, I started to capture the places, I knew this was the resource room. But my first place to capture
            was the dining hall actually. Because it is very important to always have meals. So, when I wanted to go to the
            dining hall, the library or the lecture rooms, the guide could show it to me. They showed me all the places I needed
            to go, and I slowly started to capture you know, when you stay in a place for a long time you get a mental picture.
            And also by the course that I did in mobility. So, it gave me a lot of knowledge".<br><br> <br><br> <i>Musa leaves the resource
            room and let the white cane explore the surface in front of him. He continues moving fast on an outdoor corridor. He seems
            to know exactly where to go. He says:</i> "So, I started to move alone. I was like…no, I don't want to move with a
            guide. I want to try moving alone. So, I started to move alone. Taking myself to lectures. Taking myself to the shop".
            <i>Musa turns to the left when he recognizes a corner with his cane.</i><br><br> <i>He says:</i> "Taking myself to the dining hall
            and all other places of importance".<br><br> <i>He continues walking and reaches some stairs. A new corner is in front
            of him and Musa turns right on his way towards a shop.<br><br> He reaches the shop and says:</i> "Hello. Can I have a soda?"
            <br><br> <i>A shopkeeper gives Musa a soda.</i><br><br> <i>When receiving the bottle Musa says:</i> "Thank you."<br>
            <br> <i>Afterwards Musa
            follow the same route back to the resource room.</i></p></enable-read-more>
        <enable-grey-box e-type="warning"><p>The differences in colour have meaning in some countries, for example
            white cane indicates
        that the person is blind while the green cane indicates that a person has low visual loss.</p></enable-grey-box>

        <h4>Guides</h4>
        <p>you will find people being guided by others, who are commonly referred to as sighted guides.
            Guide dogs are trained and can navigate various
            obstacles. However, the challenge is that the guide dogs cannot interpret street signs, including
            traffic lights. Furthermore, guide dogs are restricted by some religious organizations. Therefore,
            it seems difficult for people with visual impairment to be assisted by a guide dog.</p>

        <p>In the African context the use of guide dogs is minimal, it also has negative connotation. People are
            more comfortable when assisted by their friends and family members especially children for social reasons.</p>

        <h4>But is the use of children as guides problematic?</h4>

        <enable-read-more label="Transcribed interview"><p>On the issue of the human guides, unfortunately most blind people use human
            guides as I said. Many of us use our wives, maybe blind women also use their husbands, sighted husbands. Where there are no
            sighted husbands, where there are no sighted wives, we use our sighted children. I have children who are sighted. So now
            when I want to go to market, that day the child will not go to school. That child has to stay at home to guide me to the
            market. May be to hospital, maybe to town, maybe for a meeting. So eventually this child starts performing very badly at
            school because I used him every day to accompany me somewhere.<br>
            Secondly, we are mature people, we are big men, we are big women we use our children even during privacy. For example,
            I want to go to a toilet, my sighted child is going to guide me to a toilet where I could go alone using my white cane
            or using a guide dog if we were using guide dogs. Instead of the child accompanying me to the toilet. For example, I want
            to befriend prossy? as a girl as a lady. I use my own child for a social evening. I want to go to a bar, I want to go
            to some social life, I want to go for a dance. I go with a child! And eventually, the child learns behaviour which is not
            good for children. It is child abuse, in other words. That is child abuse. But worst of all, the child’s rights are
            completely deprived. When the child is supposed to go to play, you are taking him to a bar to accompany you. When the
            child is supposed to go and read his books, you are taking the child for a dance. You know. So, there are so many
            inconveniences in depending on children guides.
