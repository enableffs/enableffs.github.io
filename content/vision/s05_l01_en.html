    <div layout-padding layout="column" class="partialContent">
        <p><strong>Inclusion</strong> is the practice of educating the learners with visual impairment in the same school and class alongside other learners.<br>
        
     
        The school should always plan her programmes and activities with this learner in mind. The learner should be involved in all aspects of school life and activities almost at the same level of participation as other learners. The learner should be supported in curriculum activities or areas that require the sense of sight.</p>

<p><strong>Segregation</strong>  is when the learners are in a special school where all the other learners are visually
    impaired. Therefore, it is a school where all the learners are visually impaired. Due to advances in medical
    research and intervention, effective preventive and intervention measures have been devised, which have led to
    declining numbers of <enable-link href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/">persons with visual impairment in the world</enable-link>.
    As a result, some segregated schools have adapted reverse inclusion by enrolling non-visually impaired learners. Thus,
    segregated settings are on the decline in some parts of East Africa.</p>

        <h3>Support for learner with visual impairment</h3>
        <p>The support may be in adapting the curriculum and teaching methods. It may also involve the provision of specialized
                    technology and assistive devices, and allowing more time to complete tasks among others. Inclusion is usually successful
                    when it is facilitated by progressive policies, appropriate planning, provision of resources and a knowledgeable and specially
                    trained teacher.</p>
                <h4>Support for learners with albinism</h4>
                <p>As a matter of fact, there is no problem to do with inclusion in terms of the general participation in
                    different activities. There is segregation though in the sense that in the classroom, in the schools,
                    there are no experts to deal with people with albinism.<br>
                    Usually ordinary teachers, teachers who don´t know much about people with albinism would think that
                    students or people with albinism are stubborn. So they cannot attend to the problems in that special
                    way. Having teachers who are not trained in how to attend problems of people with albinism is
                    regarded as depriving their rights. Education is important to everyone. People with albinism should get
                    quality education. </p>
                    <h5>Some useful pieces advices:</h5>
                    <enable-grey-box>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most of communication with people with albinism should be in writing, especially in schools.</li>
                            <li>The font size should be big, the font Tahoma should not be below the size 16.</li>
                            <li>Students with albinism should sit in front of the class, close to the teacher, where they do not have to struggle with
                                reading the board.</li>
                            <li>The dust from the chalk is harmful for people with albinism.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </enable-grey-box>

            <h3>Support in the regular classroom</h3>

                <p>The first question teachers ask is:</p>
        <h5>What sort of support will be in place for the learners with visual impairment?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Most regular education teachers have no idea how to deal with a student who uses Braille. Therefore, a teacher
            skilled in teaching Braille should be available to directly teach and support the learners with visual
            impairment, as well as assist the regular education teacher. This means both teachers must work closely
            together in order to make this situation work well. This can happen, but it requires a lot of hard work.<br><br> Most school systems do not allow for a specially trained teacher to be available all day, so the schedule should be worked out in a way that meets the learner’s needs within the limits of the specially trained teacher.</p>

                <h5>Organizing the classroom</h5>
       <p>I have organized the class in such a form that we are using two boards: the blackboard and the whiteboard. The purpose
           is to help the low vision to really view. They are sitting in different coins(?), so when I use that one side
           the others that are extreme maybe will disadvantaged. Yet I will ask them to sit there.
           The visually impaired learn alongside the sighted, well, and they are baried(?) of that a lot like they were
           on their own. They can easily learn about the capabilities that also as sighted have been able to learn about
           the capabilities of those who are visually impaired. I think they could not have done so if they were on their own.</p>
                <h5>Interacting with the environment</h5>
                <p>We have also had the visually impaired learners interact very well with the environment, so they don´t
                    have any environmental challenges. They cope with the environment very well. Even in their home
                    environment, because some of these scholars for example, they have been able to cope with the
                    challenges they meet on their way, right from the school environment all the way to their home
                    environment. So with the many challenges that we have, that is the environmental problem that we
                    have in the institution. These are assisted the learners even to cope with several environmental
                    which they are confounded to. They move to any environment. They can be able to adjust and cope
                    with that environment. So two, the sighted have been able to assist them very well in tasks they
                    are doing in school. And the same, those who are also sighted are been able to learn from the
                    visually impaired learners. And they have been interested in even doing what the others are
                    doing, like learning braille. They are also learning. So that has been good on that part also,
                    because that could be their future career with handling the visually impaired persons.</p>
                <h5>Interacting socially</h5>
                <p>They are very good friends, they play together, they interact together socially, in all social spheres.
                    Out of the field they sosialize together. When they move even to dining they sosialize together.
                    And even in the church, because they normally meet in the church and they sing together. So they
                    have been able to have friends and that can also be an advantage to them once they grow up and they
                    want to be married. So they love somebody at least as spose. Their love is no problem because they
                    realize that there is really no main difference from them. That is a very good experience because
                    in the past they never had sposes. They been having problems getting their partners, but now with
                    inclusion they can really cope with the situation and understand their capabilities and they can
                    live very well.</p>
                <h5>I am a happy teacher</h5>
                    <p>It is very great to be a learner in an inclusive class. Very interesting indeed. All those challenges are very interesting. I am happy to have a class like this. It gives me a lot of strenght and even expose me into getting about these learners more. At least I have a variete of learners, not  one particular group of learners. At least I have several of them wether low  vision , wether some totally blind, wether regular. We all cope in the same group, then there is no problem.</p>

            <h3>Social integration</h3>

                <p>Many children with visual impairment have significant problems adapting socially in the regular
                    classroom even with support from teachers. Other children may not easily accept a blind or child with low vision without some
                    directions. The ability of a child to socially adapt depends on the individual. Some children may
                    make the adjustment easier than others. <br><br>Today, we hear a lot about the importance of inclusion.
                    Learners with visually impairment can be served well in a regular education classroom setting,
                    but the best placement for them cannot be determined across the board. Each learner’s needs must
                    be carefully considered in order to determine the placement that will best benefit them and provide
                    a stimulating learning environment for that particular learner.</p>

        <enable-read-more label="Audio description"><p>In a classroom at Bishop Willis Demonstration School in Iganga,
            Uganda a male teacher is standing in front of a class which consists of around 100 students from upper secondary school.
            In the front row several blind students sits together with sighted students.<br><br>
           The teacher lifts a hen and shows it to the students when he asks:
            What name is given to this one?<br><br>
            The students answer: A hen.
            <br><br>
            The teacher continues:
            A hen, very good. Now, if this is a hen we looked at this is a what?
            <br><br>
            The teacher points of a part of the hen and the students answer:
            A mouth.
            <br><br>
            The teacher brings the hen close to a blind student, Kasamba, and let him touch the hen when he says:
            Kasamba, you can see what about this side?
            <br><br>
            Kasambas fingers touch the different parts of the hen.
            <br><br>
            The teacher continues:
            Aha. He points at a particular part of the hen’s body and let Kasamba touch the same part when he says: What is that?
            <br><br>
            Kasamaba uses his tactile senses and answers:
            Beak
            <br><br>
            The teacher moves his fingers to another part and let Kasamba´s fingers follow the teachers movements. The teacher asks:
            Beak? Aha. Then there?
            <br><br>
            Kasamba answers:
            This is head.
            <br><br>
            The dialogue between the teacher and Kasamba continues:
            Head. Then? And ... It has also a neck.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile the female head teacher says, first off screen then on screen:
            My school is Bishop Willis Demonstration School which is an inclusive school.
            <br><br>
            In the classroom the teacher writes about the types of feather on the blackboard. On the first row both blind and sighted students
            sits together.
            <br><br>
            The head teacher continues saying: It is inclusive in a way that has the normal children and the special needs education children.
            We include them in the normal classes so at least they should not feel isolated. They are also human beings like the others.
            <br><br>
            In a resource room a blind student write on a Perkins braillewriter. A blind teacher touches the braille paper and read what is
            written. There are several teachers who helps the visually impaired students.
            <br><br>
            The head teacher says:
            When it once comes for trying for braille, they have their resource room. They come to the braille room and the specialist in
            special needs train them in how to read and how to write using the braille machine. And they have about five teachers who are specialists
            who handle these visually impaired children.</p>
